### Key Principles

- **Skills are self-contained.** Each skill is an independent folder under `skills/`. Skills cannot reference or depend on other skills.
- **SKILL.md is the entry point.** The AI agent reads `SKILL.md` first. Everything the agent needs to know must be reachable from there.
- **References are supplementary.** Large reference material goes in `references/` subdirectories, linked from SKILL.md.
- **No build system.** This is a documentation and skill-definitions repository. There is no compilation, bundling, or package publishing from this repo.

### Multi-Tool Compatibility

Skills work with **Claude Code**, **Google Gemini CLI**, **OpenAI Codex CLI**, **Cursor IDE**, and **GitHub Copilot coding agent**. Keep every `SKILL.md` file tool-agnostic markdown — no references to Claude-specific tool names, Anthropic-only plugin features, or vendor-specific slash commands inside skill bodies.

Tool wiring lives outside `skills/`:

| Tool | Integration file | Mechanism |
|------|------------------|-----------|
| Claude Code | `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` | Plugin marketplace discovers `skills/` via plugin manifest |
| Google Gemini CLI | `.gemini/settings.json` (`context.fileName`), `.gemini/commands/*.toml` | Gemini loads `GEMINI.md` / `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` as project context; discovers `SKILL.md` files on-demand via `.agents/skills/` |
| OpenAI Codex CLI | `AGENTS.md` (symlink → `CLAUDE.md`), `.agents/skills/` (symlink → `skills/`) | Codex scans `.agents/skills/` for `SKILL.md` files, reads `AGENTS.md` as project instructions |
| Cursor IDE | `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` | Scoped MDC rules: `token-optimization` (always-apply), `skill-structure` + `content-quality` (glob-scoped), `skill-review` + `pr-review` (agent-requested) |
| GitHub Copilot coding agent | `AGENTS.md` (symlink → `CLAUDE.md`) | Copilot reads `AGENTS.md` natively (since Aug 2025) |

When adding a skill, only touch files under `skills/uipath-<name>/` — the root integration files already wire every tool up automatically.

## Adding a New Skill

### 1. Choose a Name

Skill folders follow the naming convention: `uipath-<domain>` or `uipath-<tool>`.

- Use **kebab-case** (lowercase, hyphens between words)
- Prefix with `uipath-` for UiPath-related skills
- Be descriptive but concise: `uipath-rpa`, `uipath-platform`, `uipath-maestro-flow`

### 2. Create the Folder Structure

At minimum, a skill needs:

```
skills/uipath-<your-skill>/
└── SKILL.md
```

For skills with substantial reference material:

```
skills/uipath-<your-skill>/
├── SKILL.md
├── references/
│   ├── commands-reference.md
│   ├── api-guide.md
│   └── <subdomain>/
│       └── detailed-topic.md
└── assets/
    └── templates/
        └── template-file.ext
```

### 3. Write SKILL.md

SKILL.md is the most important file. It uses YAML frontmatter followed by markdown content.

#### Frontmatter Format

```yaml
---
name: uipath-<your-skill>
description: "<identity> (<unique signal>). <core actions>. For <confusing-case>→<correct-skill>."
---
```

> **1024-character limit.** Claude Code truncates the combined `description` + `when_to_use` at 1,536 characters in the skill listing ([source](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills.md)). This repo caps `description` at 1024 chars to leave headroom and keep descriptions focused; the pre-commit hook enforces it. Front-load the skill identity and unique file/domain signals (e.g., `.cs`, `.xaml`, `.flow`) within the first ~100 characters.

**Required frontmatter fields:**

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `name` | Exact skill identifier, must match the folder name |
| `description` | Under 1024 chars. Front-load identity and unique signals, then core actions, then compact `→` redirects for commonly confused sibling skills. Do NOT use verbose `TRIGGER when:` / `DO NOT TRIGGER when:` clauses — they waste characters. |

**Optional frontmatter fields:**

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `allowed-tools` | Restricts which tools the skill can use (e.g., `Bash, Read, Write, Glob, Grep`) |
| `user-invocable` | Defaults to `true`. Set to `false` if the skill should only be discoverable by the agent, not directly invocable by users |

#### Content Structure

Follow this structure in the markdown body:

```markdown
# Skill Title

Brief description of what the skill does.

## When to Use This Skill

- Bullet list of scenarios that should activate this skill

## Critical Rules

Numbered list of rules the AI agent MUST follow. These are the most important
part of your skill — they prevent the agent from making mistakes.

1. **Rule name** — Explanation and rationale
2. **Another rule** — ...

## Quick Start / Workflow

Step-by-step instructions for the most common use case.

## Reference Navigation

Links to reference documents in the `references/` folder for detailed topics.
```

**Tips for writing effective skills:**

- **Lead with rules.** The Critical Rules section prevents the agent from making expensive mistakes. Put the most important constraints first.
- **Be prescriptive, not descriptive.** Tell the agent exactly what to do, not just what's possible.
- **Include CLI commands verbatim.** Show the exact commands with flags. Agents work best with copy-paste-ready instructions.
- **Specify `--output json`** for any CLI commands whose output needs to be parsed programmatically.
- **Include anti-patterns.** A "What NOT to Do" section saves more time than a "What to Do" section.
- **Link to references for depth.** Keep SKILL.md focused on workflow and rules. Move detailed API docs, schemas, and examples into `references/`.

### 4. Register Lifecycle Status

Every skill must declare its maturity in [`assets/skill-status.json`](assets/skill-status.json) — the single source of truth (status is NOT stored in SKILL.md). Add an entry under `skills`:

```json
"uipath-<your-skill>": {
  "status": "preview",
  "confluence": { "page_id": null, "url": null },
  "last_synced": null
}
```

Use one of: `stable`, `preview`, `in-development`. Then regenerate the README status table and validate:

```bash
python3 scripts/check-skill-status.py --write-readme
python3 scripts/check-skill-status.py
```

CI (`validate-skill-status.yml`) fails if a skill is missing from the manifest, has an invalid status, leaves a stale `[PREVIEW]` / `> **Preview**` marker in SKILL.md, or if the README table is out of date.

### 5. Add Reference Documents (Optional)

Reference files go in `references/` and follow these conventions:

- **File naming:** `kebab-case.md` (e.g., `commands-reference.md`, `api-guide.md`)
- **Guide files:** Use the `-guide.md` suffix (e.g., `orchestrator-guide.md`)
- **Organize by subdomain** when a skill covers multiple areas (e.g., `references/integration-service/`, `references/lifecycle/`)
- **Link from SKILL.md** so the agent can discover them

### 6. Add Templates/Assets (Optional)

Static files like code templates go in `assets/`:

- **Templates:** Use the `-template` suffix (e.g., `codedworkflow-template.md`)
- **Nested folders** are fine for organization (e.g., `assets/templates/`)

## Modifying an Existing Skill

1. **Read before editing.** Understand the existing SKILL.md and references before making changes.
2. **Preserve the Critical Rules section.** These exist for a reason. If you need to change a rule, explain why in your PR description.
3. **Don't break frontmatter.** The `name` and `description` fields are parsed by the plugin system. Validate your YAML.
4. **Test your changes.** After editing, verify the skill still activates correctly for its intended scenarios.
5. **Coordinate with CODEOWNERS.** Check who owns the skill and tag them in your PR.

## Hooks

Hooks are defined in `hooks/hooks.json` and run during plugin lifecycle events (e.g., `SessionStart`).

- Hook scripts must work **cross-platform** (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Use `bash` as the shell — avoid OS-specific commands
- Keep hooks idempotent — safe to run multiple times
- Set appropriate timeouts (default: 180 seconds)

### Git Hooks

This repository uses pre-commit hooks to validate skill descriptions (1024-character limit). To enable them:

```bash
bash scripts/setup-hooks.sh
```

This configures git to use `.githooks/` and enables the skill description validator.

## Testing Skills

Skills are tested using [coder_eval](https://github.com/UiPath/coder_eval) — a framework that runs an AI agent against a task and scores the result. Tests live in `tests/tasks/<skill-name>/` and verify that the skill guides the agent to use the correct CLI commands, follow critical rules, and produce valid output.

There are three test types, distinguished by tags:

| Tag | Purpose | Cadence |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `smoke` | Skill triggers correctly, CLI produces valid output (1-5 simple scenarios) | Every PR |
| `integration` | Correct output across diverse scenarios, error paths, anti-patterns | Daily |
| `e2e` | Full lifecycle: Explore -> Plan -> Build -> Validate -> Deploy -> Run | Daily/weekly (check [Dashboard](https://dataexplorer.azure.com/dashboards/20cc55fe-33ae-4973-a951-855e76528219)) |

### Running Tests

```bash
cd tests
make install       # one-time: install coder-eval from GitHub
make all           # run all tests (smoke + integration + e2e)
make smoke         # run all smoke tests
make integration   # run all integration tests
make e2e           # run all end-to-end tests
make test-uipath-maestro-flow  # run all tests for a specific skill
```

### Adding Tests for a Skill

1. Create `tests/tasks/<skill-name>/` matching your skill folder name
2. Add at minimum **1 smoke test** and **1 e2e test** (required for every new skill PR)
3. Use minimal prompts — the goal is to test the skill's guidance quality, not hand-hold the agent
4. Tag every task appropriately: `smoke`, `integration`, or `e2e`
5. Follow the task ID pattern: `skill-<domain>-<capability>`
6. **Do not score self-reports.** Don't ask the agent to write a `report.json` / `recommendation.json` summary and then have `success_criteria` read that file back — the agent can write any value. Score real artifacts (`.flow` content, generated CSVs), real operations (`run_command` re-executes a validation), or behavior signals (`command_executed`, `command_not_executed`, `skill_triggered`).

See `tests/README.md` for the full task YAML template, success criteria reference, and examples from existing tests.

### Analyzing Test Coverage

Use the `/test-coverage` slash command to see what a skill's tests cover and where gaps exist:

```bash
/test-coverage uipath-maestro-flow   # single skill
/test-coverage all                    # all skills
```

This produces a markdown report in `tests/reports/` with component coverage, rule coverage, priority-ranked gaps, and concrete recommendations for new tests to write. Run this before and after adding tests to measure your progress.

### Scaffolding a Test with `/generate-task`

Use the `/generate-task` command to scaffold a single task YAML from a free-form description. The command always infers the target skill from the description — do not pass a skill name.

```bash
/generate-task smoke test for folder listing via uip orchestrator
/generate-task e2e flow that uses HITL with an approval gate and write-back
/generate-task cover the new uip flow registry get subcommand
```

Generated tasks are **unverified scaffolds**. Before merging, run the task end-to-end with `coder-eval` and add a passing-run claim to the PR description (the lint workflow flags missing claims as High severity). Verify that CLI commands, success criteria, and prompts match the skill's actual behavior, and adjust weights and thresholds based on what matters most for your skill.
