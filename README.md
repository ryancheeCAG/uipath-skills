# UiPath Agent Skills

> [!NOTE]
> **Work in Progress** — This repository is under active development. Skills are being added and refined. Contributions, feedback, and ideas are welcome! See [Contributing](#contributing) below.

UiPath Agent Skills give AI coding agents the domain knowledge to build, run, test, and deploy UiPath automations and agents — directly from your development environment. Each skill is a self-contained package of instructions and resources that teaches your coding agent how to perform a specific UiPath task.

## Quick Start

> **Prerequisite:** [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS) is required — it includes `npm`.

```bash
npm -g install @uipath/cli
uip skills install
```

Select the skills you need from the wizard. Skills are installed into your coding agent's directory and ready to use.

<summary>Don't have Node.js installed?</summary>

**macOS**
```bash
brew install node
```

**Windows**
```bash
winget install OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS
```

**Linux**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://fnm.vercel.app/install | bash
fnm install --lts
```
See [Installing Node.js via package manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) for other methods.

After installing, verify with `node -v` and then run the quick start command above.

## Skill Catalog

The repository contains skills for building and managing UiPath automation projects — coded workflows in C#, RPA workflows in XAML, Flow projects in JSON, desktop/browser UI automation, and platform operations.

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **uipath-rpa** | Full assistant for UiPath automations — coded workflows (C#) and low-code RPA workflows (XAML). Create, edit, build, run, and debug automation projects |
| **uipath-maestro-flow** | Create, validate, and debug UiPath Flow projects using the `.flow` JSON format and `uip` CLI |
| **uipath-platform** | Authentication, Orchestrator management, resources, Integration Service, traces, licensing, and CLI tools |
| **uipath-solution** | PDD → SDD authoring AND `uip solution` lifecycle (init, pack, publish, deploy, activate) for `.uipx` multi-project solutions |
| **uipath-agents** | End-to-end toolkit for UiPath coded agents: scaffold, build, run, evaluate, deploy (LangGraph, LlamaIndex, OpenAI Agents, Simple Function) |
| **uipath-coded-apps** | Build, sync, package, publish, and deploy UiPath Coded Web Applications — push/pull to Studio Web, pack into .nupkg, publish to Orchestrator, deploy to production |

## Agents

| Agent | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Project Discovery** (`uipath-project-discovery-agent`) | Auto-discovers UiPath project structure, dependencies, conventions, and generates context files for Claude Code (`.claude/rules/project-context.md`) and UiPath Autopilot (`AGENTS.md`). Triggered automatically when a UiPath project is detected without existing context, or on explicit user request. |

## Multi-Tool Support

This repository works with **Claude Code**, **Google Gemini CLI**, **OpenAI Codex CLI**, and **Cursor IDE**.

### Claude Code

This repository works as a **Claude Code plugin**. Install skills via `uip skills install` (the recommended method above) — this keeps skills updated automatically.

> **Avoid manual plugin installation** (e.g., `claude plugin marketplace add` / `claude plugin install`). Manually installed plugins must be updated manually, and you may miss skill updates and fixes.

If you've already installed manually, uninstall and re-install via `uip skills install` to switch to automatic updates.

#### Reduce permission prompts

By default, Claude Code prompts for approval on every `uip` command, and a realistic Flow or RPA build runs 25+ distinct subcommands. Claude Code plugins cannot ship permission allowlists declaratively, so run this once to install a curated allowlist of safe read-only commands (registry lookups, validation, local scaffolding) while keeping prompts for side-effectful operations (login, debug, publish):

```text
/uipath:install-permissions
```

The command prints the recommended JSON and offers to merge it into your settings (`~/.claude/settings.json` for global, or project-local `.claude/settings.local.json`). You will also see a one-line nudge at session start until an allowlist is installed.

### Google Gemini CLI

Gemini CLI is supported by `uip skills install` — pick **Gemini CLI** when the wizard prompts for a target and skills are wired up automatically.

### OpenAI Codex CLI

This repository is configured as a Codex CLI skill provider. The `AGENTS.md` file (symlinked to `CLAUDE.md`) provides project instructions, and skills are discovered via `.agents/skills/` (symlinked to `skills/`).

> **Windows users:** This repo uses git symlinks. Clone with symlinks enabled:
> ```bash
> git clone -c core.symlinks=true https://github.com/UiPath/skills
> ```
> If you've already cloned without symlink support, re-enable and re-checkout:
> ```bash
> git config core.symlinks true
> git checkout -- .
> ```

### Cursor IDE

Project rules are provided in `.cursor/rules/` and are automatically loaded by Cursor.
