# tests/tasks/uipath-troubleshoot — Test Scenario Generator

This directory contains faithful-replay test scenarios for the `uipath-troubleshoot` skill. Each scenario replays a real troubleshooting investigation against a `uip` CLI mock so the agent's reasoning is exercised without hitting a real UiPath tenant. A scenario for a new failure class is new acceptance coverage when first added; once committed and green it serves as a regression guard against future skill/playbook changes.

This file tells you (Claude or a contributor) how to **add a new scenario** from a real session you just resolved.

## When to use this guide

Trigger:

- You ran the `uipath-troubleshoot` skill against a real failing job, reached a verified resolution, and want to lock the case in as a faithful-replay scenario (a regression guard going forward).
- A user reports a new failure class not yet covered by an existing scenario.

Skip:

- Tweaking an existing scenario's manifest or fixtures — edit them directly, no generation pass needed.
- Adding tests for *other* skills — use `.claude/commands/generate-tasks.md` instead.

## Inputs

A new scenario needs four sources. Three are mandatory; the fourth is optional.

| Input | Required | Source |
|-------|----------|--------|
| `--investigation <dir>` | yes | The `.local/investigations/` directory written by the troubleshooting skill: `state.json`, `hypotheses.json`, `evidence/`, `raw/`, `depth-check.json`. |
| `--project <dir>` | no | The UiPath project source that was failing. Snapshotted into the new scenario's `process/`. Omit when the troubleshooting is purely CLI-driven (no project source available). |
| `--transcript <path>` | yes | A `.jsonl` file or a directory. Directory mode walks `*.jsonl` recursively and treats files under `subagents/` as sub-agent transcripts (their `uip` calls count, their final text is ignored). Source of truth for `uip` calls + presenter output. |
| `--resolution <file>` | no | Pre-written `RESOLUTION.md`. If omitted, the generator extracts the presenter's final assistant message from the transcript. |
| `--scenario-name <name>` | no | Folder name for the new scenario. If omitted, inferred from project name + failing job key. |
| `--group <group>` | yes | Group folder — e.g. `activity-packages`, `products/orchestrator`, `runtime-exceptions`, `cross-system`. Sets placement, the depth-correct `_shared` path, and the default domain tag. Activity packages are flat under `activity-packages/`; the `--scenario-name` carries the package token (`db-`, `word-`, …). See [Scenario grouping](#scenario-grouping). |

## Workflow — ask before writing

The generator runs in two passes. **Always preview before applying.**

### 1. Preview

```bash
python tests/tasks/uipath-troubleshoot/_shared/scripts/generate_scenario.py \
  --investigation <path> \
  --project <path> \
  --transcript <path> \
  [--resolution <path>] \
  [--scenario-name <name>] \
  --group <group> \
  --dry-run
```

`--group` is the group folder the scenario belongs to (see [Scenario grouping](#scenario-grouping)). It sets three things at once: where the scenario folder is written, the depth-correct `_shared` path inside `task.yaml`, and the default product/domain tag. Pass it for every new scenario — omitting it falls back to flat placement at the suite root (deprecated).

Output: a plan describing every file that would be written (paths + sizes + first lines), the inferred scenario name, the manifest rules extracted, and any scrub substitutions that would be applied.

### 2. Confirm with the user

Show the preview. Ask:

- Is the scenario name correct?
- Are the manifest rules complete (every `uip` arg signature the agent ran)?
- Does the extracted `RESOLUTION.md` match the agent's final answer? (Or should they supply one explicitly?)
- Are the scrub substitutions correct (placeholders mapped to the right real values)?

Do not proceed without explicit user confirmation.

### 3. Apply

```bash
python tests/tasks/uipath-troubleshoot/_shared/scripts/generate_scenario.py \
  ... same flags as preview ... \
  --apply
```

Writes the scenario folder. Prints the path. Exits.

### 4. Verify

After write:

1. Run the smoke test pattern to confirm the mock dispatcher resolves:
   ```bash
   cd tests
   .venv/bin/coder-eval run tasks/uipath-troubleshoot/<group>/<scenario>/task.yaml -e experiments/default.yaml -v
   ```
2. The first run should score 1.0 — the test was generated from a known-good resolution.
3. Open `m/.calls.jsonl` from the run artifact to confirm every expected call was hit.

## Mandatory scrub list

Before writing any file, the generator MUST replace:

| Pattern | Replacement |
|---------|-------------|
| Personal Windows paths (`D:\...`, `C:\Users\...`, etc.) | Strip prefix → relative path, OR generic description |
| Real internal email addresses (`<name>@uipath.com`) | `original_email@test.com` (resource owner), `replacement_email@test.com` (runner) |
| Real first names used as identifiers | `original_user`, `replacement_user` |
| Filenames containing real emails | Renamed to placeholder |
| Hostnames matching `DESKTOP-*`, `<surname>-*` | `MOCK-HOST` |

Scrub applies to: every fixture JSON, every Markdown body, every YAML field, every filename in the `process/` snapshot.

The generator MUST surface its scrub-substitution table during the dry-run preview so the user can verify mappings before write.

## Scenario grouping

Scenarios sit in group folders. Do NOT add a scenario at the flat suite root — pick its group folder. Tests within a group are NOT sub-grouped further; they sit flat inside the group.

**Activity-package scenarios are FLAT under `activity-packages/`** — there is no per-package subfolder. The package is encoded as a short prefix on the scenario name (`db-`, `cv-`, `excel-`, `gsuite-`, `mail-`, `o365-`, `py-`, `sys-`, `uia-`, `web-`, `word-`, `classic-`). This keeps installed file paths under the Windows 260-char `MAX_PATH` limit (a per-package subfolder added ~20 wasted chars to every path).

```
tests/tasks/uipath-troubleshoot/
├── _shared/                     # shared mock dispatcher + scripts (never a scenario)
├── smoke-manifest-commands/     # the sole smoke task (stays at root)
├── activity-packages/           # FLAT — scenarios named <token>-<slug>
│   ├── db-execute-query-timeout-expired/      data/m/r/ …
│   ├── excel-rr-sheet-bytes/                   data/m/r/ …
│   ├── uia-node-not-found/  word-replace-text-file-locked/  …
├── products/

│   ├── integration-service/     <scenario>/ …
│   └── maestro/                 <scenario>/ …
├── runtime-exceptions/          <scenario>/ …
└── cross-system/                <scenario>/ …   # root cause spans ≥2 systems
```

**Pick the group + package token by where the failure's playbook lives:**

| Failure surface | Group | Scenario prefix |
|---|---|---|
| An activity package (Word, Excel, Python, Mail/Outlook, O365, GSuite, Web, CV, System, UI Automation, Classic, Database) | `activity-packages` | `word-` `excel-` `py-` `mail-` `o365-` `gsuite-` `web-` `cv-` `sys-` `uia-` `classic-` `db-` |
| Orchestrator-only (job/robot/queue/licensing/logon state, no single activity) | `products/orchestrator` | — |
| Integration Service connectors / connections | `products/integration-service` | — |
| Maestro / BPMN instances | `products/maestro` | — |
| Generic .NET workflow exception (null-ref, argument-null) not tied to a package | `runtime-exceptions` | — |
| Root cause genuinely spans ≥2 systems (e.g. an Excel activity failing on an IS connection) | `cross-system` | — |

The `--group` flag wires up placement, the depth-correct `_shared` path, and the default tag. The `_shared` path depth follows the nesting: `activity-packages/<scenario>/`, `runtime-exceptions/<scenario>/`, and `cross-system/<scenario>/` are one level deep → `../../_shared/mock_template`; `products/<product>/<scenario>/` is two deep → `../../../_shared/mock_template`. For activity packages pass `--group activity-packages` and a `--scenario-name` that already carries the package token (e.g. `db-execute-query-timeout-expired`).

## Scenario folder layout

A single scenario (leaf) under its group folder:

```
tests/tasks/uipath-troubleshoot/<group>/<scenario-name>/
├── task.yaml                    # tags, mock_path_dirs, llm_judge criteria
├── README.md                    # what the original session uncovered
├── RESOLUTION.md                # ground truth for the LLM judge
├── data/                        # short dir names keep Windows paths under MAX_PATH (260)
│   └── m/
│       └── r/
│           ├── manifest.json    # rules (canned + passthrough) + unmocked_default
│           └── *.json           # canned stdout per rule with `file:` (name = sha1[:10] of args)
└── process/                     # snapshot of the failing UiPath project (optional)
    └── ...
```

`task.yaml` MUST set `sandbox.mock_path_dirs: ["m"]` and overlay the scenario's `data/` via a `template_dir` source — without it, bare `uip` resolves to the real CLI and the test will try to authenticate. (Dir names are single letters — `data/m/r/` — deliberately: verbose `fixtures/mocks/responses/` paths pushed the plugin's installed file paths past the Windows 260-char `MAX_PATH` limit.)

## Mock dispatch precedence

The shared `m/uip` dispatcher walks the manifest's `rules` array (first match wins). Each rule has one of:

- `file: <path>` — return the canned response under `r/<file>`.
- `passthrough: true` — proxy to the real `uip` CLI installed on the host. Use this for open-ended commands like `docsai ask` whose query strings vary between runs. Responses are cached to the sandbox's `r/_cache/<key>.json` for in-run reuse; the cache is **not** persisted to the source — every run hits the live CLI on its first call for each unique query.

When no rule matches:

1. `unmocked_default` (if set) — return its `response` + `exit_code`.
2. Otherwise, error on stderr.

Test runs require valid `uip` auth on the host (set via `.env` or environment) for any rule with `passthrough: true` to succeed.

## Task YAML requirements

Every new scenario's `task.yaml` MUST satisfy the following.

### `run_limits`

```yaml
run_limits:
  task_timeout: 5400
  max_turns: 60
  turn_timeout: 3600
```

Troubleshooting investigations span many turns and produce large intermediate outputs. Use `task_timeout: 5400` (90 min) and `turn_timeout: 3600` (60 min) so the full triage → hypothesis → tester → depth-check → presenter chain has headroom — proxy-mode runs cluster around 25–55 min wall, so a 30-min `task_timeout` clips right before the presenter spawn on the slow end of the distribution.

`task_timeout`, `max_turns`, and `turn_timeout` belong inside the `run_limits:` block (the canonical location after the c/2026-05-12-unify-run-limits migration). Top-level placement still works via a grace shim but is deprecated; setting both top-level and `run_limits:` raises `ValueError` on the validator.

### `tags`

Tags MUST be lowercase kebab-case — the coder-eval schema rejects PascalCase or spaced names (e.g., `RPA` and `Integration Service` are invalid; use `rpa` and `integration-service`).

Must include `uipath-troubleshoot` AND at least one product/domain tag from this list:

| Tag | When to apply |
|-----|---------------|
| `rpa` | Anything touching an activity package or `.xaml` workflow. **Default for any activity-package-related failure.** Apply alongside other tags when the failure spans domains (e.g., a preflight that hits both System.Activities and IS connectors gets both `rpa` and `integration-service`). |
| `flow` | Maestro Flow / flow-graph artifacts |
| `bpmn`, `maestro` | BPMN-modelled processes (Maestro). Apply both. |
| `case-management` | Case Management product |
| `integration-service` | IS connectors, connections, connector activities |
| `hitl` | Human-in-the-loop / Action Center / Tasks |
| `agents` | Agent runtime, agent definitions |
| `ixp` | Intelligent Xtraction and Processing |
| `document-understanding` | Document Understanding (extraction models, classification, validation, projects) |
| `llm-gateway` | LLM Gateway (model routing, BYO connections, product LLM configurations) |
| `data-fabric` | Data Fabric tables, entities |
| `api-workflow` | API workflow artifacts |
| `orchestrator` | Orchestrator control-plane failures — job/robot lifecycle (pending, faulted, killed, foreground-slot), logon/credentials, queues, licensing, machine state — diagnosed via `uip or`. Not tied to a single activity package. Add `rpa` too when an RPA process's execution is directly involved (e.g. foreground-slot, job-killed). |

**Tag ↔ group agreement.** The domain tag MUST match the [group folder](#scenario-grouping): every `activity-packages/*` scenario carries `rpa`; `products/orchestrator` → `orchestrator`; `products/integration-service` → `integration-service`; `products/maestro` → `maestro`. `--group` adds the matching tag automatically.

**Multiple tags are encouraged.** A scenario that touches more than one domain carries a tag for each — this is required for `cross-system/` scenarios (e.g. an Excel activity faulting on an IS connection gets `rpa` AND `integration-service`). Add the extra tags by hand after generation; `--group` only seeds the primary one.

### Tier tag: scenarios are `e2e`, NEVER `smoke`

Every faithful-replay scenario is an end-to-end investigation — tag it **`e2e`**, never `smoke`.

The PR smoke gate (`.github/workflows/smoke-skills.yml`) treats **any** change under `skills/uipath-troubleshoot/` as a skill-source change and runs that skill's **entire `smoke`-tagged set**. A `smoke`-tagged scenario therefore runs on every docs/playbook PR — each scenario is a multi-minute agent run, so the gate becomes slow, expensive, and exposes unrelated PRs to scenario flakiness and CI-infra blips (image-pull, judge variance). That is the wrong signal for a fast PR gate.

**The ONLY troubleshoot task tagged `smoke` is [`smoke-manifest-commands`](./smoke-manifest-commands/task.yaml)** — a fast, deterministic fixture/manifest-command validation (no agent investigation). It is the sole troubleshoot smoke-gate check by design.

Rules:

1. New scenarios get `e2e` (+ product/domain tags) — **do NOT add `smoke`**.
2. Do not add `smoke` to any scenario to "make it run in CI"; the e2e suite (`tests/experiments/e2e.yaml`) covers scenarios.
3. The only file that may carry `smoke` is `smoke-manifest-commands/task.yaml`.

### Investigation output location

The skill writes investigation artifacts to `.local/investigations/` — NOT `.investigations/`. Every `file_exists` criterion path and every post-run script path MUST use `.local/investigations/...`.

### `docsai` mocking

Any rule matching `uip docsai ask ...` in `manifest.json` MUST be `passthrough: true`. Query strings vary between runs and canned responses go stale immediately; the dispatcher caches passthrough responses per query for in-run reuse.

```json
{
  "match": "docsai ask",
  "passthrough": true
}
```

### `success_criteria`

Every scenario MUST include exactly TWO criteria, and ONLY these two:

1. **`skill_triggered`** — verify `uipath-troubleshoot` activated. Without this, the agent can fake an answer by reading fixture files directly and bypassing the skill entirely (we have seen this happen).
2. **`llm_judge`** — grade whether the agent reached the correct conclusion against `RESOLUTION.md`.

**Do NOT add any other criterion type.** Specifically forbidden across the whole troubleshoot suite:

- ❌ `file_exists` — testing whether `.local/investigations/state.json` (or any internal file) was written grades bookkeeping, not the deliverable. `skill_triggered` already verifies the skill ran.
- ❌ `file_contains` — grading the shape of `state.json` / `hypotheses.json` punishes correct skill behavior (multiple playbooks legitimately match; hypotheses legitimately stay `pending` after early-stop).
- ❌ `command_executed` — encodes one investigation path; an agent reaching the right answer via a different (still valid) CLI route gets false-failed.

Concrete failure mode this rule prevents: an agent that reaches the correct root cause via `jobs logs` (skipping `jobs get`) is graded FAILURE solely because a `command_executed` rule required `jobs get d5fed611`. The conclusion was right; the path was different. Brittle.

Anything task-specific the test needs to verify goes in `RESOLUTION.md`. The judge reads it via `include_reference` and compares.

#### Judge configuration — single canonical shape for every task

Every `llm_judge` criterion across all troubleshoot tasks uses the **same** prompt, the same flags, and the same description. Per-task customization lives in `RESOLUTION.md`, never in `task.yaml`.

**Canonical `llm_judge` block** (copy verbatim into every new scenario):

```yaml
- type: llm_judge
  description: "Agent's diagnosis matches RESOLUTION.md"
  weight: 3.0
  pass_threshold: 0.7
  include_reference: true
  include_agent_output: true
  prompt: |
    Grade the agent's final answer against the attached RESOLUTION.md.

    Score on whether the agent identifies the same root cause and
    recommends the same fix as RESOLUTION.md:

      1.0  Same root cause AND same fix (or equivalent).
      0.8  Same root cause; fix is right area but vague.
      0.5  Adjacent cause, missing a key specific.
      0.2  Wrong direction; recognized surface only.
      0.0  Misdiagnosed or blocked.

    Return JSON: {"score": <float>, "rationale": "<one sentence>"}
```

**What the judge sees** (both flags MUST be `true`):

- `include_reference: true` — passes `RESOLUTION.md` (the file named under `reference:` at the task root)
- `include_agent_output: true` — passes the agent's final user-facing response

That is **all** the context the judge gets. The contract: agent's final answer vs. RESOLUTION.md → score. Tool calls are deliberately excluded — the judge grades the presented diagnosis, not how it was reached.

**Forbidden on `llm_judge`:**

- ❌ `files:` array (passing `state.json`, `hypotheses.json`, or any internal artifact). The judge grades presentation, not bookkeeping.
- ❌ Custom prompt language per task — no `DIMENSION A / DIMENSION B`, no `SCORING RUBRIC` clauses citing specific playbook names, no "Evidence sources" enumerations referencing `matched_playbooks` / `is_root_cause` / etc.
- ❌ Per-task hedging notes ("Be substance-focused", "multiple playbooks may match", etc.). The lean rubric already encodes this.

**Why:** the skill's internal state (`state.json`, `hypotheses.json`) is bookkeeping for the next conversation, not a deliverable. Multiple playbooks may legitimately appear in `matched_playbooks`; hypotheses legitimately stay `pending` after early-stop (see SKILL.md "When to stop testing"). Grading on internal-state shape punishes correct skill behavior. What the agent **presents** is the contract.

**Where task-specific guidance lives:** `RESOLUTION.md`. If the judge needs to know that a specific fix must name "AlterIfDisabled = True" or that "Test Heals pool" is wrong — that goes in `RESOLUTION.md` as the authoritative root cause + fix. The judge reads it via `include_reference` and grades against it.

**Lean default for every new scenario:**

```yaml
success_criteria:
  - type: skill_triggered
    description: "Agent invoked the uipath-troubleshoot skill"
    skill_name: "uipath-troubleshoot"
    expected_skill: "uipath-troubleshoot"
    weight: 1.0

  - type: llm_judge
    description: "Agent's diagnosis matches RESOLUTION.md"
    weight: 3.0
    pass_threshold: 0.7
    include_reference: true
    include_agent_output: true
    prompt: |
      Grade the agent's final answer against the attached RESOLUTION.md.

      Score on whether the agent identifies the same root cause and
      recommends the same fix as RESOLUTION.md:

        1.0  Same root cause AND same fix (or equivalent).
        0.8  Same root cause; fix is right area but vague.
        0.5  Adjacent cause, missing a key specific.
        0.2  Wrong direction; recognized surface only.
        0.0  Misdiagnosed or blocked.

      Return JSON: {"score": <float>, "rationale": "<one sentence>"}
```

## Anti-patterns

- **Do not** add `command_executed` criteria. The lean contract is `skill_triggered + llm_judge` only — no `command_executed`, no `file_exists`, no `file_contains`. Asserting a specific CLI command was run encodes one investigation path and false-fails agents that reach the correct conclusion via a different (still valid) route. If a test needs to verify a specific CLI fact, put the fact in `RESOLUTION.md` and let the judge grade it. See the `success_criteria` section above for the full forbidden list.
- **Do not** hand-edit a generated scenario's `manifest.json` to "make tests pass." If the agent calls a command not in the manifest, that's a coverage gap — add a rule with the verbatim recorded response.
- **Do not** include the original `.local/investigations/` outputs in the committed scenario. The fresh run produces its own.
- **Do not** ship real email addresses, real personal Windows paths, or real machine hostnames. The scrub pass is mandatory.
- **Do not** use `git add -A` after generation — the generator drops scratch files in `_tmp/`. Stage explicitly: `git add tests/tasks/uipath-troubleshoot/<group>/<scenario>/`.
- **Do not** create a scenario without a verified resolution. The LLM judge needs an authoritative ground truth; a half-baked `RESOLUTION.md` produces flaky scores.
- **Do not** tag a scenario `smoke` — scenarios are `e2e`. The only troubleshoot task allowed the `smoke` tag is `smoke-manifest-commands` (see [Tier tag](#tier-tag-scenarios-are-e2e-never-smoke)).

## Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `_shared/scripts/extract_session.py` | Parse a Claude Code JSONL transcript → `{uip_calls, presenter_output, inferred_scenario_name}`. Pure parser, no file writes. Stdout JSON. |
| `_shared/scripts/generate_scenario.py` | Orchestrate inputs → scenario folder. Two modes: `--dry-run` (default, prints plan) and `--apply` (writes files). Calls `extract_session.py`. Runs the scrub pass. |
| `_shared/scripts/coverage_report.py` | (Existing.) Compare expected vs performed `uip` calls per replicate after a test run. |

## When the user just asks "capture this as a test"

If a user says "save this as a regression test" mid-session and provides no flags, infer:

- `--investigation` → `.local/investigations/` in the cwd
- `--project` → walk up from cwd looking for the nearest `project.json`
- `--transcript` → most-recent JSONL under `~/.claude/projects/<slug>/sessions/`
- `--resolution` → omit, extract from transcript
- `--scenario-name` → infer from the failing job's `ReleaseName` + a short slug
- `--group` → infer from the faulted activity's package / the investigated product, using the [Scenario grouping](#scenario-grouping) table (e.g. a `UiPath.Word.Activities` fault → `--group activity-packages` with a `word-`-prefixed scenario name; an Orchestrator-only job/robot issue → `products/orchestrator`; a root cause spanning ≥2 systems → `cross-system`)

Then run `--dry-run`, show the plan, confirm.
