"""Deploy-to-folder + patch-bump-on-redeploy check.

The agent must deploy twice to the same Orchestrator folder. The
second deploy fails with `Version already exists` unless the agent
bumps the patch version in `pyproject.toml` between the deploys
(documented in the skill's Troubleshooting table).

Asserts:
  1. `acme-echo/pyproject.toml` is valid TOML with a `[project]` table.
  2. The `version` follows semver `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.
  3. The `version` is strictly greater than `0.0.1` (the scaffold default
     `uip codedagent new` writes). Any of `0.0.2`, `0.1.0`, `1.0.0`, etc.
     proves a bump happened.
  4. The edit landed: `main.py` mentions the `acme: ` prefix the user
     asked for (otherwise the second deploy would be a no-op rebump).
  5. No `[build-system]` section (Critical Rule C1).
