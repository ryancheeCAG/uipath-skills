"""Diagnose check: trajectory-evaluator-on-plain-StateGraph trap.

Quickstart Step 7 documents that
`uipath-llm-judge-trajectory-similarity` scores 0.0 on plain
`StateGraph` agents because `AgentRunHistory` is empty. The skill
proposes two valid fixes:

  Fix A — swap the evaluator for one that matches the user's stated
  need: "a simple 'did the right keyword end up in the output'
  check." That's `ContainsEvaluator`
  (`evaluatorTypeId: "uipath-contains"`). Other output-based
  evaluators don't fit the user's described semantics.

  Fix B — add `@traced()` decorator (from `uipath.tracing`) to the
  graph entrypoint so AgentRunHistory spans actually populate.
  Heuristic signal: `main.py` now imports from `uipath.tracing` and
  applies `@traced()` to the agent function.

Either fix is acceptable; both is fine. The check fails only if
NEITHER signal is present — that means the agent walked away with
the trap still in place, or applied a fix that doesn't match what
the user asked for.

Beyond the fix, the check also verifies:
  - the seeded `main.py` was preserved (the routing logic that
    was working should not have been rewritten),
  - `evaluatorRefs` and the eval set's per-case `evaluationCriterias`
    were updated consistently if the evaluator id changed (Fix A),
    so the eval set still parses.
