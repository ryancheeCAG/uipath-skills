"""Local Workspace iteration check — preserve SW-owned files, edit the graph, run both branches.

Asserts:
  1. `.sw-path-marker` and `.local/folder.lock` are still present (untouched).
  2. `project.uiproj` still exists (Local Workspace anti-pattern: do not delete it).
  3. `.env` still contains the original `UIPATH_PROJECT_ID=ws-baseline-...` sentinel.
  4. `main.py` declares a `category` field on the LangGraph output schema.
  5. `entry-points.json` advertises a `category` output (init regenerated the schema).
  6. `outputs.json` captured a `tiny` run for value=2 and a `huge` run for value=150.
