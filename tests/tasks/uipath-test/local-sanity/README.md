# UiPath Test Manager — P&E Validation Scenarios

Behavioural eval scenarios for the **`uipath-test`** skill (the `uip tm` command surface), mapped to the Confluence *P&E Evaluation Scenarios* matrix. Each file is a [coder_eval](https://github.com/UiPath/coder_eval) task: a natural-language prompt plus `command_executed` success criteria.

> **Local-only.** These carry `skip: true` and run outside CI against a live tenant (`codereval` / `DefaultTenant`).

## Running
```bash
cd tests
SKILLS_REPO_PATH=$(cd .. && pwd) \
  .venv/bin/coder-eval run "tasks/uipath-test/local-sanity/**/*.yaml" \
  -e experiments/pe.yaml -j 6 --no-preserve
```

`experiments/pe.yaml`: `max_turns: 60`, `turn_timeout: 450`, `task_timeout: 700`. Execution/link-automation scenarios use the published [`fixtures/TestManagerSmoke/`](fixtures/TestManagerSmoke/README.md) automation (folder `Shared/uipath-test`, key `fcf79fe1-147b-4000-82b3-9eb81b165452`, serverless robot pre-assigned).

## Legend
- **Tier** — `Smoke` (`gating:must-pass`) · `Edge` (`gating:edge-case`)
- **Type** — `Read` · `Write` · `Error/boundary`
- **Surface area** — the `uip` command(s) the scenario's criteria assert. Every scenario also verifies `uip login status` first (the skill's connectivity check), so that's omitted from the column below.

## Summary

- **69 scenarios** across 15 areas of the `uip tm` surface: project, test cases (read + write), requirements, test sets, execution, defects/labels, attachments, custom fields, traceability, Orchestrator integration, Jira-linked requirements, auth/permissions, and CLI/error handling.
- All execution + link-automation scenarios run against the published [`TestManagerSmoke`](fixtures/TestManagerSmoke/README.md) automation (Shared folder, serverless robot).
