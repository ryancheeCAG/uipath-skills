# Dashboard Capability — Test Suite

Tests for the `uipath-coded-apps` dashboard generation capability. The skill generates
production-ready React dashboards from natural-language prompts using the UiPath Insights
RTM API and TypeScript SDK.

## How to Run

```bash
cd tests

# All dashboard tests (default experiment — dev/local)
make test-uipath-coded-apps

# By tier
make tags TAGS="uipath-coded-apps smoke"        # PR-gate (fast, ~40 turns)
make tags TAGS="uipath-coded-apps integration"  # Daily
make tags TAGS="uipath-coded-apps e2e"          # Nightly (full lifecycle)

# Single test
SKILLS_REPO_PATH=$(cd .. && pwd) \
  .venv/bin/coder-eval run tasks/uipath-coded-apps/dashboard/smoke/dashboard_scaffold.yaml \
  -e experiments/default.yaml
```

## Test Architecture

### Shared validator: `_shared/check_dashboard.py`

A reusable Python script called via `run_command` criteria. Validates project structure,
env vars, widget count, Insights routing, startTime constants, and absence of hardcoded
UUIDs — without running tsc (use `--no-tsc` for integration tests).

```
--min-widgets N        At least N .tsx files in src/widgets/
--require-insights     At least one widget imports useInsights
--require-sdk          At least one widget uses SDK (QueueItems, Jobs.getAll, etc.)
--require-recipe ENDPOINT  At least one widget references this endpoint string
--require-starttime    Widgets use named constants (SEVEN_DAYS_AGO) not inline Date.now()
--no-tsc               Skip tsc --noEmit (used when node_modules may not be present)
```

### Incremental test template: `incremental/templates/existing_dashboard/`

A pre-built 1-widget scaffold used as `sandbox.template_sources` for the incremental test.
Contains a working `ActiveAgentsKpi.tsx` widget and `index.ts` export so the incremental
test starts from a known state.

---

## Activation Prompts

Defined in `tests/tasks/activation/uipath-coded-apps.jsonl` (rows 051–060).

These measure whether the skill fires correctly on dashboard-related prompts.
Run with `tests/experiments/activation.yaml` (1-turn binary classifier).

| Prompt | Expected |
|--------|----------|
| "build me an agent health dashboard" | `uipath-coded-apps` |
| "create a dashboard showing agent error rates and latency" | `uipath-coded-apps` |
| "show me agent metrics — active count, P95 latency, top erroring agents" | `uipath-coded-apps` |
| "generate an analytics dashboard with KPIs for my agent fleet" | `uipath-coded-apps` |
| "build a governance posture dashboard showing policy violations" | `uipath-coded-apps` |
| "I want to see invocation volume and success rate as a chart" | `uipath-coded-apps` |
| "I need an operations dashboard showing job completion trends" | `uipath-coded-apps` |
| "create a cost dashboard tracking AGU consumption by agent" | `uipath-coded-apps` |
| "build me a UiPath agent health dashboard: active agents, error rate trend" | `uipath-coded-apps` |
| "add a governance violations widget to my existing dashboard" | `uipath-coded-apps` |

## Smoke Tests (`smoke/`)

Run on every PR. Fast (≤40 turns, 900s). No real API calls — validates structure and
agent behavior only.

### `dashboard_plan_gate`
**What it tests:** The approval gate — agent must show a plan before building anything.

**What passes:**
- `npm ci` was NOT run before the user approved (max_count: 0)
- Agent produces no scaffold files before approval

**Why it matters:** Without this, agents scaffold immediately on any dashboard-related
prompt, ignoring the plan→approve workflow that prevents misbuilt dashboards.

---

### `dashboard_scaffold`
**What it tests:** Core scaffold correctness — all required files and env vars are written.

**What passes:**
- `package.json` and `.env.local` exist
- All 6 env vars present: `VITE_UIPATH_CLOUD_URL`, `VITE_UIPATH_BASE_URL`, `VITE_UIPATH_ORG_NAME`, `VITE_UIPATH_TENANT_NAME`, `VITE_INSIGHTS_TENANT_ID`, `VITE_UIPATH_PAT`
- `src/widgets/` directory and `index.ts` exist
- At least one widget uses `useInsights`
- `npm ci` ran (scaffold executed)
- `App.tsx` imports from widgets

**Why it matters:** Catches regressions in scaffold creation, missing env vars, or broken
PAT auth — all of which produce broken dashboards at runtime.

---

### `dashboard_disambiguate`
**What it tests:** Ambiguous prompts halt before building and ask a clarifying question.

**What passes:**
- `npm ci` NOT run (no scaffold before disambiguation)
- `package.json` NOT created

**Why it matters:** Without disambiguation, a prompt like "I need something to track
performance" scaffolds arbitrarily. The approval gate depends on the agent asking first.

---

## Integration Tests (`routing/`, `build/`)

Run daily. Verify correct routing decisions and widget generation patterns.

### `dashboard_sdk_routing`
**What it tests:** SDK-routed metrics use SDK, not Insights.

**Prompt:** Queue items, running jobs, pending Action Center tasks

**What passes:**
- Queue widget: `QueueItems` present in widgets
- Jobs widget: `Jobs.getAll` or `jobs.getAll` pattern
- Tasks widget: `Tasks.getAll` or `tasks.getAll` pattern
- No widget uses `jobs.getCompletedTimeline`, `jobs.getSummary`, or similar Insights jobs endpoints for these operational metrics

**Why it matters:** Routing operational state (live counts, current status) to Insights
instead of SDK produces wrong data — Insights is for historical aggregates, not live state.

---

### `dashboard_insights_routing`
**What it tests:** Insights-routed metrics use the correct namespace and endpoint.

**Prompt:** Agent error trend, P95 latency per agent, top agents by error count

**What passes:**
- Error trend widget: `agents.getErrors` endpoint
- Latency widget: `agents.getLatencyTimeline` endpoint
- Top agents widget: `agents.getTopErroredAgents` endpoint
- All three use `useInsights` (not raw fetch)
- check_dashboard.py validates structure + Insights routing

**Why it matters:** Wrong endpoint (e.g., `traceview.getLatencyTimeline` instead of
`agents.getLatencyTimeline`) returns different data shapes and causes runtime errors.

---

### `dashboard_recipe_usage`
**What it tests:** The agent uses Widget Recipes from `insights-catalog.md` rather
than inventing custom patterns.

**Prompt:** Error trend (7 days), active agent count (KPI), top agents by AGU consumption (bar)

**What passes:**
- Error trend: `agents.getErrors` endpoint (Recipe 1)
- Active agents KPI: `agents.getAgents` endpoint (Recipe 3)
- Consumption bar: `agents.getConsumption` endpoint (Recipe 10)
- Widgets include TypeScript response type annotations (`useInsights<{...}>` generic)

**Why it matters:** Without recipes, agents invent arbitrary data shapes that produce
`(data as any)?.data?.wrong?.path ?? []` — silently empty charts at runtime.

---

### `dashboard_multiwidget`
**What it tests:** A 5-widget dashboard builds correctly end-to-end with all major
endpoint types covered.

**Prompt:** Active agents (KPI), error trend (line), invocation activity (area),
P95 latency (line), top agents (table)

**What passes:**
- 5 widget files in `src/widgets/`
- `agents.getAgents`, `agents.getErrors`, `agents.getConsumptionTimeline`, `agents.getLatencyTimeline` all present
- `App.tsx` imports from widgets
- `tsc --noEmit` passes

**Why it matters:** Per-widget correctness doesn't guarantee the full project compiles.
This test catches type errors that emerge only when all widgets are combined.

---

### `dashboard_starttime`
**What it tests:** Widgets use named `startTime` constants, not inline `Date.now()` arithmetic.

**Prompt:** Agent error trend (7 days) and agent success rate (30 days)

**What passes:**
- At least one widget uses `SEVEN_DAYS_AGO`, `THIRTY_DAYS_AGO`, or a clearly named `const *Ago` variable
- No widget passes `Date.now()` subtraction directly into `useInsights`
- check_dashboard.py `--require-starttime` passes

**Why it matters:** Inline `Date.now() - 604800000` in each widget causes time windows
to drift by seconds between widget renders. Named constants ensure all widgets share
the same query window.

---

## E2E Tests (`build/`, `incremental/`)

Run nightly. Full lifecycle, real credentials, complete pipeline.

### `dashboard_full_e2e`
**What it tests:** The complete 8-phase build pipeline — plan → scaffold → routing →
widget generation → tsc → browser open.

**Prompt:** "Build me a UiPath agent health dashboard: active agents, invocation volume
over 24 hours, error rate trend for the week, and top agents by usage with health scores."

**What passes:**
- `package.json` created
- `.env.local` with correct `VITE_UIPATH_CLOUD_URL` (alpha.uipath.com, not api.uipath.com)
- `.env.local` with `VITE_UIPATH_BASE_URL` matching `.*api\.uipath\.com`
- `VITE_UIPATH_PAT` starts with `ey` (valid JWT token from uip login)
- `agents.getAgents`, `agents.getConsumptionTimeline`, `agents.getErrors` all in widgets
- `src/widgets/index.ts` exports present
- `App.tsx` includes `DashboardShell`
- `tsc --noEmit` passes
- check_dashboard.py: 4 widgets, Insights routing, startTime constants, no hardcoded UUIDs
- Agent final summary does NOT mention `tsc`, `TypeScript`, or `package.json`

**Why it matters:** This is the primary regression gate for the full dashboard capability.
Any breakage in auth, scaffold, routing, or TypeScript compilation is caught here.

---

### `dashboard_incremental`
**What it tests:** Adding a widget to an existing dashboard only writes the new widget —
no re-scaffolding, no overwriting existing widgets.

**Setup:** Pre-seeded project with one existing widget (`ActiveAgentsKpi.tsx`) via
`sandbox.template_sources`.

**Prompt:** "Add a widget to my existing dashboard showing governance violations
over the last 30 days."

**What passes:**
- New governance widget created in `src/widgets/`
- New widget uses `governance.get*` endpoint
- `ActiveAgentsKpi.tsx` still exists and still contains `agents.getAgents`
- `index.ts` still exports `ActiveAgentsKpi`
- `npm ci` NOT run again (no full re-scaffold)
- `tsc --noEmit` passes
- check_dashboard.py: 2 widgets, Insights routing, no hardcoded UUIDs

**Why it matters:** Without incremental mode, every "add a widget" request re-scaffolds
the entire project, wiping user customizations and taking 2-5 minutes unnecessarily.

| Capability | Test | Tier |
|---|---|---|
| Plan shown before scaffold | `dashboard_plan_gate` | smoke |
| Scaffold creates correct structure | `dashboard_scaffold` | smoke |
| Ambiguous prompt asks question | `dashboard_disambiguate` | smoke |
| SDK signals → SDK endpoints | `dashboard_sdk_routing` | integration |

| Skill triggers on dashboard prompts | activation prompts 051–060 | activation |

## Known Limitations

- Tests do not make live Insights API calls — widget routing is verified by checking
  endpoint names in generated code, not by running the app
- The incremental test uses a pre-seeded template, not a real previously-built dashboard
- Deploy flow (`plugins/deploy/impl.md`) is not yet covered by automated tests
