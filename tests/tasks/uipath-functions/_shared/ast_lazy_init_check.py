"""AST scan for the lazy-LLM-init invariant.

`references/coded/quickstart.md` Critical Rule C4:

  > Always instantiate `UiPath()` inside functions/nodes, never at
  > module level.
  > NEVER instantiate `UiPathAzureChatOpenAI`, `UiPathChat`,
  > `UiPathChatOpenAI`, or any LLM client at module level — `uip
  > functions init` imports the file and module-level LLM clients
  > will fail because auth hasn't happened yet.

This module finds module-level *call expressions* that look like LLM
client construction (e.g. `llm = UiPathAzureChatOpenAI(...)` at column
zero). Use it from check scripts to verify positive tests obey the rule
and from anti-pattern tests to verify the agent refactored a known
violation away.

The check is conservative — it flags by class name only and does not
attempt to follow imports. False negatives are possible if the agent
aliases a class to a non-LLM-shaped name; false positives are rare in
practice because `UiPath*Chat*` is a UiPath-specific convention.

Usage:

    from _shared.ast_lazy_init_check import find_module_level_llm_clients

    violations = find_module_level_llm_clients(Path("main.py"))
    if violations:
        sys.exit("FAIL: " + ", ".join(violations))
