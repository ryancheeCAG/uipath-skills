# Skill activation eval

Measures whether a skill activates iff a user prompt warrants it. Treated as a
binary classifier (yes/no) and scored with accuracy / precision / recall / F1
plus a confusion matrix.

## Layout

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `<skill>.jsonl` | Positives for that skill — every prompt should fire that skill. `expected_skill` is injected per file by `activation.yaml`. |
| `negative.jsonl` | Shared negatives — prompts that should fire **no** skill (small talk, unrelated dev tasks, adjacent UiPath products, other workflow tools). |
| `activation.yaml` | coder-eval task config. Uses `dataset.paths` to merge all skill jsonls + `negative.jsonl`, and stacks 19 `skill_triggered` criteria — one per skill — each computing its own confusion matrix from the same agent traces. |

The `expected_skill` field on each row is the row's true label (the skill it should fire, or `""` for negatives). Each criterion compares its own `skill_name` to `expected_skill`: `expected="yes"` iff they match. So for skill X:
- `<X>.jsonl` rows are positives.
- All other rows (`<Y>.jsonl` for Y≠X plus `negative.jsonl`) are negatives — exercising cross-skill confusion.

## Run

```bash
export SKILLS_REPO_PATH=/path/to/skills
uv run --project /path/to/coder_eval coder-eval run \
  skills/tests/tasks/activation/activation.yaml \
  -e skills/tests/experiments/activation.yaml \
  --backend bedrock \
  --preserve \
  -j 4

# Quick subsample for iteration:
uv run --project /path/to/coder_eval coder-eval run \
  skills/tests/tasks/activation/activation.yaml \
  -e skills/tests/experiments/activation.yaml \
  --backend bedrock --sample 20 -j 4
```

Reports land in `tmp/<run-id>/`. The suite gate fails per criterion on `recall.yes < 0.70`. Class imbalance (~50 yes / ~900 no per skill) makes accuracy and recall.no trivially high; recall.yes is the only meaningful gate.

## Adding a new skill

1. Create `<new-skill>.jsonl` with positive prompts (one JSON object per line, fields: `id`, `prompt`).
2. Optional: add must-not-fire prompts that touch your skill's domain to `negative.jsonl` as adversarial negatives.
3. Edit `activation.yaml`: add the new file to `dataset.paths` and append a 19→20th `skill_triggered` criterion with `skill_name: uipath-<new-skill>`.

## Cost

On Sonnet 4.6 via Bedrock, ~$0.05–$0.10 per row. The dataset is ~950 rows total. The agent runs ONCE per row regardless of criteria count, and the 19 stacked criteria are pure-Python evaluation against the same trace, so the full benchmark across all 19 skills costs **~$50–95**. Use `--sample N` for cheaper iteration (note: `--sample` slices first-N, which biases toward the first-listed paths; useful for smoke runs, not for metrics).

## Provenance

Per-skill positives were curated by mining real user prompts from skill-specific
Slack channels (read-only) and synthesizing the rest from each `SKILL.md`'s
canonical task verbs. Some skills have narrower scope than 50 prompts can fill
without padding (e.g., `uipath-feedback` at 26, `uipath-tasks` at 34) — the
file just stops at the highest count quality could sustain.

## Coverage

Covers most skills in the repo. Brand-new skills (especially Preview-tagged
ones whose CLI surface is still in flux) may be added on a delay so prompt
curation doesn't chase a moving target.
