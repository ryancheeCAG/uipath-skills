"""Delete Studio Web solutions uploaded by ``uip maestro flow debug`` during a task.

Wired in via ``post_run`` in flow e2e task YAMLs. Runs from the sandbox CWD
after evaluation completes; finds every ``.uipx`` file under it, reads
``SolutionId``, and best-effort deletes each via ``uip solution delete``.
``.uipx`` files without a ``SolutionId`` are skipped.

Cleanup policy is controlled by the ``FLOW_E2E_CLEANUP`` env var:

* ``always`` (default) — delete regardless of outcome. Use in CI.
* ``never`` — delete nothing. Use when actively debugging locally so the
  solution stays available in Studio Web for inspection.

Best-effort: failures here never affect pass/fail (post_run results are
informational only), so this script always exits 0.
