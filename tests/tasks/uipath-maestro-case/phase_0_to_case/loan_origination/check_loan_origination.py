"""LoanOrigination Phase 0 → case generation: logical-integrity grader.

Checks that the agent-generated caseplan.json from the Accrual Capital
commercial-loan-origination narrative encodes a workable process, not
just a structurally valid one:

  - 6 primary stages exist with the expected names
  - Gating chain Intake → Loan Setup → Underwriting → QA/QC → Closing → Resolved
    exists as an edge path (allowing arbitrary intermediate routing)
  - At least 3 of the 4 named exception lanes (Customer Comms, Escalation,
    Withdrawn, Rejected) exist as ExceptionStage nodes OR as regular stages
  - Withdrawn and Rejected are terminal (no outgoing edges leaving them
    back into the happy path) and at least one terminal exception drives a
    case-exit condition that marks the case complete
  - Resolved is required and terminal
  - At least one conditional rule references the >$5M Credit-Analyst gate
  - Total task count is realistic (≥ 25)
