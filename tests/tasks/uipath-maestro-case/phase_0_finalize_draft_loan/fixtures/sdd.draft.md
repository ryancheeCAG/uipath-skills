# SDD — LoanOrigination

A case definition blueprint for the commercial term-loan origination lifecycle at
Accrual Capital. Each case represents one loan application from receipt through funding
(or adverse disposition), spanning Intake → Loan Setup → Underwriting → QA/QC →
Closing → Resolved, with four exception paths (Customer Comms, Escalation, Withdrawn,
Rejected).
