Runs the activation eval restricted to one skill's positives and fails if

Re-baseline by editing BASELINES_PCT after a fresh full activation run.

# activation run. Nearest 5%. Skills omitted have no activation test set
# yet (uipath-admin, uipath-ixp) — the gate SKIPs them.
# uipath-solution is the merged successor of uipath-solution-design + the
# `uip solution` slice of uipath-platform; rebaseline after the next full run.
#
# uipath-rpa: held at the pre-merge modern value of 70 after the
# uipath-rpa-legacy merge (PILOT-5232). The legacy half's 75% baseline
# was measured against the dedicated legacy skill description; the
# merged uipath-rpa description dilutes legacy signals, so the
# combined recall is expected to land closer to the modern half.
# Re-baseline after the first full activation run on the merged dataset.
