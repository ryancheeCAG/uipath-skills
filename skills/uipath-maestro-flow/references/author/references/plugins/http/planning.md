# HTTP Request Node — Planning

> **MUST READ FIRST:** [/uipath:uipath-platform — http-request.md](../../../../../../uipath-platform/references/integration-service/http-request.md). This file is the flow-specific authoring layer on top.

## Node Type

`core.action.http.v2` (Managed HTTP Request)

> **Always use `core.action.http.v2`** for all HTTP requests — both connector-authenticated and manual. The older `core.action.http` (v1) is deprecated and does not pass IS credentials at runtime.

## When to Use a Managed HTTP Request Node

| Situation | Use Managed HTTP? |
| --- | --- |
| Connector exists but lacks the specific curated activity | Yes — connector mode with target connector's connection |
| No connector exists, but service has a REST API | Yes — manual mode with full URL |
| Quick prototyping against any REST API | Yes — manual mode |
| Connector exists and covers the use case | No — use [Connector Activity](../connector/planning.md) |
| Target system has no API (desktop app) | No — use [RPA Workflow](../rpa/planning.md) |

For the two-mode concept (connector vs. manual) and the `url` / auth rules per mode, see the platform doc linked at the top.

## Ports

| Input Port | Output Port(s) |
| --- | --- |
| `input` | `default`, `error`, `branch-{id}` (dynamic, one per `inputs.branches` entry) |

- `default` — primary success output, or fallback when configured branches don't match.
- `error` — implicit error port; fires when the call fails (network error, timeout, non-2xx not caught by a branch). Shared with all action nodes — see [Implicit error port on action nodes](../../../../shared/file-format.md#implicit-error-port-on-action-nodes).
- `branch-{id}` — HTTP-specific, configured via `inputs.branches` (response-content routing). See [Conditional Branches](#conditional-branches) below.

## Output Variables

- `$vars.{nodeId}.output` — `{ body, code, method, rawStringBody, request }` on success
- `$vars.{nodeId}.error` — `{ code, message, detail, category, status }` when the error port fires

## Conditional Branches

Use `inputs.branches` when you need to route downstream paths based on response content (e.g., empty vs non-empty results). For generic call-failure handling, prefer the shared `error` port instead — don't enumerate every bad status code as a branch.

Each branch's `conditionExpression` is a JS expression with `$self` bound to the current HTTP node's output:

```json
{
  "inputs": {
    "branches": [
      { "id": "hasItems",  "name": "Has Items",  "conditionExpression": "$self.output.body.items.length > 0" },
      { "id": "empty",     "name": "Empty",      "conditionExpression": "$self.output.body.items.length == 0" }
    ]
  }
}
```

Wire `branch-hasItems` / `branch-empty` as source ports on outgoing edges. `default` fires when no branch condition matches.

> **Do not use `=js:` on `conditionExpression`** — HTTP branch conditions are evaluated as JS automatically (same rule as decision/switch expressions). See [variables-and-expressions.md](../../../../shared/variables-and-expressions.md#http-branch-condition-inputsbranchesconditionexpression).

## Dynamic values

IS activity input fields (`url`, `headers`, `body`, `query` under `bodyParameters`) do **not** resolve `{$vars.x}` brace-templates — the template runner only applies to native flow fields. Use `=js:` expressions for any dynamic value; template literals with `${...}` interpolation or string concatenation both work. See [Step 3b — Dynamic values](impl.md#step-3b--dynamic-values-in-url--headers--body--query) for the full rationale and examples.

## Key Inputs (`--detail` for `node configure`)

Run `uip maestro flow node configure` with a `--detail` JSON. The CLI builds the full `inputs.detail` payload, `bindings_v2.json`, and connection resource files automatically. **Do not hand-write `inputs.detail`.**

**Connector mode** (IS connection auth):

| `--detail` Key | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `authentication` | Yes | `"connector"` |
| `method` | Yes | HTTP method: GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE |
| `targetConnector` | Yes | Target connector key (e.g., `"uipath-salesforce-slack"`) |
| `connectionId` | Yes | Target connector's IS connection ID (from `uip is connections list`) |
| `folderKey` | Yes | Orchestrator folder key (from `uip is connections list`) |
| `url` | No | API endpoint URL/path (e.g., `"/conversations.replies"`). Auto-fills both `bodyParameters.path` and `bodyParameters.url`. |
| `query` | No | Query parameters as key-value object |
| `headers` | No | Additional headers as key-value object |
| `body` | No | Request body (for POST/PUT/PATCH) |

**Manual mode** (no connector auth):

| `--detail` Key | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `authentication` | Yes | `"manual"` |
| `method` | Yes | HTTP method: GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE |
| `url` | Yes | Full target URL |
| `query` | No | Query parameters as key-value object |
| `headers` | No | Additional headers as key-value object |
| `body` | No | Request body (for POST/PUT/PATCH) |

## Prerequisites

- `uip login` required (for both modes — node type comes from registry)
- For connector mode: a healthy IS connection must exist for the **target connector**. **If none exists, STOP** — surface in **Open Questions**. See [impl.md Step 2](impl.md#step-2--identify-target-connector-and-connection-connector-mode-only) for connection recovery.
- `uip maestro flow registry pull` to cache the `core.action.http.v2` definition

## Planning Annotation

In the architectural plan, annotate managed HTTP nodes as:
- Connector mode: `managed-http: <service> — <operation>` (e.g., "managed-http: Slack — GET /conversations.replies")
- Manual mode: `managed-http: manual — <method> <url>` (e.g., "managed-http: manual — GET https://api.example.com/data")
