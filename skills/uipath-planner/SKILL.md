# UiPath Task Planner

Your job is to **elicit preferences, plan, and route** — never execute.

1. **Do NOT** write automation code (XAML, C#, Python, JSON) or create project files. Plan documents are the only files you may create.
2. **Do NOT** use Bash for anything other than the filesystem probe in Step 3 — unless in explore-first mode (see Step 1).
3. Produce a plan, then stop. The main agent loads and executes the specialist skills, which own their own internal flows.

## When to Use This Skill

- The request is **non-trivial** — multi-step, multi-skill, UI automation, or unclear scope
- The request is **ambiguous** — no single specialist skill clearly matches
- The user asks "what can I build?" or needs help choosing a project type

Skip this planner for simple, well-defined single-skill tasks (e.g., "create a workflow that sends an email") — the agent loads the specialist skill directly.

## Skill capability map

High-level view of what each specialist owns. **Do not describe internal flows of any specialist in your plan** — each skill documents its own procedures and will drift out of sync if duplicated here.

| Skill | What it owns | Handles auth? | Handles deploy? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `uipath-rpa` | RPA workflows (XAML and C# coded): create, edit, build, run, debug. Owns **all** UI automation authoring end-to-end. | No (relies on Studio) | **No** — defer to `uipath-platform` |
| `uipath-rpa-legacy` | Legacy RPA workflows (.NET Framework 4.6.1, XAML only). **Existing legacy projects only** — never for new projects unless user explicitly requests legacy. | No | **No** — defer to `uipath-platform` |
| `uipath-agents` | AI agents — code-based (LangGraph / LlamaIndex / OpenAI Agents) and low-code (`agent.json`) | Yes (`uip login`) | **Yes** — end-to-end |
| `uipath-coded-apps` | Web apps (`.uipath/` dir): build, sync, package, publish, deploy | Yes (`uip login`) | **Yes** — end-to-end |
| `uipath-maestro-flow` | `.flow` files orchestrating RPA, agents, apps | Yes (`uip login`) | **Partial** — follows plan `Solution scope` (SW or local); `uipath-platform` for Orchestrator |
| `uipath-platform` | Auth, Orchestrator resources, solution lifecycle (pack/publish/deploy), Integration Service, Test Manager | Yes (auth hub) | **Yes** — the deploy destination |
| `uipath-interact` | Inspect and interact with live desktop/browser UI: click, type, screenshot, inspect. For app launching, ad-hoc exploration, post-build verification. Does NOT author workflows or generate selectors — that's `uipath-rpa`. | No auth | **No** |

## RPA skill routing

Two RPA skills exist. Pick the right one:

| Signal | Route to |
|---|---|
| `project.json` has `"targetFramework": "Legacy"` or no `targetFramework` field | `uipath-rpa-legacy` |
| `project.json` has any other `targetFramework` (e.g., `"Portable"`, `"Windows"`) | `uipath-rpa` |
| No existing project + user explicitly asks for legacy | `uipath-rpa-legacy` |
| No existing project + no legacy request | `uipath-rpa` (default for all new projects) |
| macOS host | `uipath-rpa` — cross-platform target only (Windows target not available on macOS) |
| Windows host | `uipath-rpa` — user can choose Windows or cross-platform target |

**Rules:**
1. Never suggest `uipath-rpa-legacy` for new projects unless the user explicitly requests legacy.
2. On macOS, only cross-platform automation is supported — always route to `uipath-rpa`.
3. On Windows, `uipath-rpa` supports both Windows and cross-platform targets.

## Step 1 — Upfront elicitation

Ask the user key questions using AskUserQuestion. Only ask questions the request does not already answer. Ask **one at a time** — wait for each response before asking the next.

### Question 1: Generation approach (non-trivial automations only)

> How would you like me to work?
>
> 1. **Explore first, then plan** — analyze the project and requirements, run non-mutating discovery, then present a plan for approval before any project changes *(recommended)*
> 2. **Explore, plan, and execute simultaneously** — emit the plan as text and the main agent starts executing right away

**Skip this question** and default to simultaneous when the request is simple and well-defined, the user is modifying an existing automation, or the task is single-skill single-step.

**If "explore first, then plan":**
- You may run non-mutating discovery: `uip rpa analyze`, `uip rpa get-errors`, reading `project.json`.
- **Before promising live UIA capture in the plan**, verify all three:
  1. A project with `project.json` exists at `<PROJECT_DIR>` (or will be created in Task 1 of the plan).
  2. `UiPath.UIAutomation.Activities` version `>= 26.4.1-preview` (kept in sync with `uipath-rpa`'s declared minimum). For not-yet-created projects, check with `uip rpa get-versions --package-id UiPath.UIAutomation.Activities --include-prerelease --output json`.
  3. If a project exists, `<PROJECT_DIR>/.local/docs/packages/UiPath.UIAutomation.Activities/skills/uia-configure-target/SKILL.md` is present.
- If any check fails, the plan MUST either (a) include a Task 0 to install/upgrade UIA to the minimum and run `uip rpa restore`, or (b) fall back to indication-only authoring and record `UI capture: indication-only` in the plan header so `uipath-rpa` does not route to `uia-configure-target`.
- Do NOT run commands that mutate the project (create files, register targets, install packages) — those belong to execution.
- After Steps 2–4, call EnterPlanMode with the plan. User approves, then ExitPlanMode.

**If "explore, plan, and execute simultaneously":**
- Emit the plan as text in Step 5. The main agent loads the first specialist skill immediately and follows that skill's own workflow.
- Do NOT call EnterPlanMode.

### Question 2: Execution autonomy

> Once execution starts, how should I handle ambiguity or scope concerns?
>
> 1. **Autonomous to completion** *(recommended)* — follow the plan end-to-end without stopping for confirmation. Only interrupt for the concrete hard blockers listed in the plan's `Stop conditions` section.
> 2. **Interactive** — pause and confirm on structural decisions, scope concerns, or side-effect actions during execution.

Record the answer in the plan header as `Execution autonomy`. Specialist skills read this field at runtime — in autonomous mode they do NOT re-ask decisions the plan already makes.

**Skip this question** only in explore-first mode — the approval gate at plan time already scopes autonomy. Default to `autonomous` for simultaneous mode when the user does not specify.

### Project type: infer first, ask only if vague

Resolve project type on your own. Stop at the first match:

1. **User explicitly named a mode** ("xaml workflow", "coded workflow", "C# workflow", ".cs file", "low-code") → honor it. Record `Project type: XAML` or `Project type: C# coded` in the plan header.
2. **Keyword signals** (look for these in the user's request, but do not echo them as labels) →
   - "agent", "AI agent", "agentic", "LLM", "LangGraph", "LlamaIndex", "OpenAI Agents" → **AI Agent**
   - "flow", "orchestrate multiple automations", `.flow` → **Flow**
   - "web app", "app", "React", "Angular", "Vue", `.uipath/` → **Application**
3. **Filesystem signals** (Step 3) → route per the Step 3 table.
4. **Default** → **RPA workflow (XAML)**. Covers ~95% of UiPath work — UI automation, form-fill, Excel / email / file ops.

Only ask if the request is genuinely vague ("I want to build something with UiPath") AND no keyword or filesystem signals apply. Ask exactly this:

> What kind of project should I scaffold?
>
> 1. **RPA workflow** — UI automation, Excel / email / file work *(recommended — covers ~95% of UiPath work)*
> 2. **AI Agent** — autonomous agent that reasons with an LLM and calls tools
> 3. **Flow** — visual node-based orchestration connecting multiple automations
> 4. **Application** — custom UI deployed as a UiPath App

If the user picks **RPA workflow**, record `Project type: XAML` and move on. **Never follow up with "XAML or C#?"** — that authoring-mode decision belongs to `uipath-rpa`, not the planner. Coded mode is set only when the user independently says "coded workflow" or ".cs file" (which rule 1 above already honors); never as a follow-up.

### Question 3: PDD/SDD document (new automations)

> Do you have a Process Definition Document (PDD) or Solution Design Document (SDD)? If so, provide the file path and I'll use it to guide the plan.

If the user provides a path, read the document and use it to inform the plan. Skip if the user is modifying an existing automation or already referenced a document.

### Question 4: Test coverage depth

> How thorough should automated testing be? (Testing is mandatory — this sets the depth only.)
>
> 1. **Standard coverage** *(recommended)* — automated tests for the primary flow plus the main edge cases and error paths I can infer from the request or PDD.
> 2. **Happy path only** — automated tests for the primary success flow; edge-case coverage is deferred.

Record the answer in the plan header as `Test coverage: standard | happy-path`. The `Testing (MANDATORY)` task in the plan body references this field so the specialist knows the scope.

**Skip this question** when:
- The user already stated coverage depth in the request (e.g., "full tests", "happy path only", "smoke test", "include edge cases") — record directly.
- The plan contains **no generation skill** (pure `uipath-interact` interaction, pure `uipath-platform` ops, pure read-only diagnostics) → record `Test coverage: N/A`.
- The request is a small modification to an existing automation and the user has not asked for new tests — default to `standard` for touched paths and note the assumption in Decisions & Trade-offs.

### Question 5: Solution scope (Flow projects only)

**Ask this question only when the plan loads `uipath-maestro-flow`.** For all other project types — RPA, AI Agent, Application — skip this question and **omit the `Solution scope` field from the plan header entirely**; no other specialist reads it.

Use `AskUserQuestion`:

- **Question:** `Where should this Flow solution live?`
- **Options:**
  - `SW solution` — Build and iterate in Studio Web.
  - `Local solution` — Build and iterate locally in VSCode.
  - `Something else` — Free-form input.

Record the answer in the plan header as `Solution scope: SW | local`. `uipath-maestro-flow` reads this field at runtime to decide whether to publish at the end.

**Skip this question** (and omit the field from the header) when:
- The plan does not load `uipath-maestro-flow`.
- The user's request already states the intent (e.g., "upload to Studio Web", "keep it local", "just build it") — record directly without asking.
- The plan contains no generation skill (pure diagnostics, pure `uipath-platform` ops, pure read-only work).

### Default: Expression language

Always use **VB.NET** for XAML workflows. Note this in the plan. Do not ask.

## Step 2 — Detect multi-skill tasks

Emit a multi-skill plan when the request clearly spans more than one specialist.

> **Legacy projects:** If the project is legacy (see "RPA skill routing" above), substitute `uipath-rpa-legacy` for `uipath-rpa` in the patterns below.

Known patterns:

### RPA build + deploy to Orchestrator

```
1. uipath-rpa     → create/edit, validate, build the workflow
2. uipath-platform → pack, publish, deploy to Orchestrator
```

`uipath-rpa` does not deploy.

### Flow with local resources

Flow and components are peer sibling projects under one `.uipx` solution at the cwd. Each is scaffolded in this plan or replaced by a placeholder contract when not built here.

```
1. uipath-maestro-flow      → create solution, init flow project
2. <skill per component>    → fan out: one task per component, routed by type
                              (rpa → uipath-rpa; agent → uipath-agents; app → uipath-coded-apps)
3. uipath-maestro-flow      → wire all components, validate, finalize per `Solution scope`
```

`<component skill>` is `uipath-rpa`, `uipath-agents`, or `uipath-coded-apps` depending on the component type.

### Flow with deployed resources

Flow references components that exist as standalone Orchestrator tenant resources — already published, or to be published this session.

```
1. <component skill>   → scaffold any unbuilt component; deploy to Orchestrator (use `uipath-platform` for RPA, which doesn't self-deploy)
2. uipath-maestro-flow → design and wire the flow against the published components, validate, finalize per `Solution scope`
```

### Flow deploy to Orchestrator

```
1. uipath-maestro-flow → validate, `uip maestro flow pack`
2. uipath-platform     → publish and deploy to Orchestrator
```

`uipath-maestro-flow` follows the plan's `Solution scope` (SW or local); Orchestrator deploy requires `uipath-platform`.

### Build + verify UI automation on the live app

User wants to build a UI automation AND observe it running on the live app.

```
1. uipath-rpa      → build the workflow end-to-end
2. uipath-interact → observe the live app, capture screenshots/snapshots to diagnose issues
3. uipath-rpa      → apply fixes from findings; repeat 2–3 as needed
```

### Verify or fix existing automation against a running app

```
1. uipath-interact → interact with the live app, identify the UI issue
2. uipath-rpa      → fix the automation based on uipath-interact findings
```

### Agent that uses RPA processes as tools

```
1. uipath-rpa      → create and publish the RPA process(es) the agent will call
2. uipath-platform → deploy the RPA process(es) to Orchestrator
3. uipath-agents   → create the agent, bind the published processes as tools, deploy
```

> **Important:** Single-app UI automation (one project, one live app, one workflow) is **not** a multi-skill pattern — it's a single-skill `uipath-rpa` task. `uipath-rpa` owns UI automation authoring end-to-end. Do not plan a separate "uipath-interact discovery" step.

## Step 3 — Filesystem detection (single-skill requests)

> **Check first:** If the request mentions deploy, publish, or Orchestrator alongside a clear domain, it likely needs a multi-skill plan from Step 2.

Probe the project context:

```bash
echo "=== CWD ===" && ls -1 project.json *.cs *.xaml *.py pyproject.toml flow_files/*.flow .uipath/ app.config.json .venv/ 2>/dev/null; echo "=== PARENT ===" && ls -1 ../project.json ../*.cs ../*.xaml ../pyproject.toml 2>/dev/null; echo "=== FRAMEWORK ===" && cat project.json 2>/dev/null | grep -o '"targetFramework"[^,}]*' || echo "targetFramework: not found"; echo "=== DONE ==="
```

| Filesystem signal | Plan skill |
|---|---|
| `.xaml` files + `project.json` with `targetFramework: "Legacy"` or absent | `uipath-rpa-legacy` |
| `.xaml` AND/OR `.cs` files + `project.json` with any other `targetFramework` | `uipath-rpa` |
| `flow_files/*.flow` | `uipath-maestro-flow` |
| `.uipath/` or `app.config.json` | `uipath-coded-apps` |
| `.venv/` AND `pyproject.toml` with uipath dependency | `uipath-agents` |
| `project.json` only (no `.cs`/`.xaml`) | Check `targetFramework` — `"Legacy"` or absent → `uipath-rpa-legacy`; otherwise → `uipath-rpa` |

**Multiple signals?** Go back to Step 2 and emit a multi-skill plan.

**No signals?** Use Step 1 answers. If still undetermined, plan with best available info and note the assumption.

## Step 4 — UI element targeting (only when the plan includes UI automation)

If the plan loads `uipath-rpa` for a workflow that clicks, types into, or reads elements in a desktop or browser app, ask the three questions defined below — **App type**, **Targeting approach**, and **App state** — in one batched `AskUserQuestion` call. Skip any question already resolved from the user's request (skip rules listed after the question definitions). Keep the wording **generic** — do not inject domain-specific names ("HR app", "Salesforce", "Workday") into the question text; the app identity lives in the plan header, not the questions.

### Question 1 of 3: App type

> What kind of application are we automating?
>
> 1. **Web / browser app** — the app runs in a browser (e.g., Workday, SAP SuccessFactors, a custom web app). I'll discover elements using browser selectors.
> 2. **Desktop app** — a Windows desktop app (WinForms / WPF / Win32). I'll discover elements from the running application window.
> 3. **Citrix / remote session** — app running in Citrix or RDP. I'll use image- and OCR-based targeting since native selectors aren't available through the remote session.

### Question 2 of 3: Targeting approach

> How should I handle the UI elements in this automation?
>
> 1. **I build it, you review it** — I write the full workflow using the most reliable selectors I can find from the live app, then you review the result in Studio and refine if needed. *(recommended — the default path for ~90% of UI automations)*
> 2. **You indicate each element** — you click through each target element in Studio's Selector editor. Adds ~3 minutes of setup but gives you Object Repository and canonical selector management from the start.

Offer only these two options. Never add a third "build it manually" or "I'll do it in Studio" option — a developer choosing manual authoring wouldn't be using a coding agent.

### Question 3 of 3: App state

> Is the app open on your machine?
>
> 1. **Yes, it's open and ready** — I'll inspect the running app, find the target form fields, and extract real selectors automatically. You don't need to do anything.
> 2. **No, I'll open it first** — I'll wait while you launch the app and navigate to the relevant screen. Tell me when you're ready and I'll start discovery.
> 3. **Skip discovery for now** — I'll scaffold the full workflow with placeholder selectors. The logic and structure will be complete, but you'll need to connect real selectors in Studio before it can run.

### Per-question skip rules

- **Skip Q1 (App type)** if the user already named the app kind. Signals: "web app", "browser", "browser-based", "Chrome", "Edge", "Safari" → `web`. "desktop app", "WinForms", "WPF", "Win32", "legacy app" → `desktop`. "Citrix", "RDP", "remote session", "remote desktop" → `citrix`. Record directly in the plan header.
- **Skip Q2 (Targeting approach)** only if the user explicitly asked for one ("you build it", "I'll indicate each element").
- **Skip Q3 (App state)** if the user already stated the app is running, not yet open, or asked to skip discovery.

If all three are resolved from context, do not call `AskUserQuestion` at all. **Skip all three** for non-UI plans (pure data processing, API calls, agent-only, flow-only).

Record the answers in the plan header. **The handoff is informational** — `uipath-rpa` does not read the plan file; it runs its own target-configuration flow when invoked. The plan-header fields exist so the human reviewer and the main agent retain the decisions in context, and so re-entry (new conversation, resumed session) has the same answers to work from.

## Step 5 — Write and save the plan

### 5a. Plan format

```markdown
# <Feature Name> Implementation Plan

**Goal:** <one sentence summarizing what the automation does>
**Source document:** <path to PDD/SDD, or "None — planned from user request">
**Project type:** <XAML (default for RPA workflows) / C# coded (only if user explicitly asked) / AI Agent / Flow / Application>
**Expression language:** VB.NET (XAML only; N/A for coded / AI Agent / Flow / Application)
**Approach:** <explore first / simultaneous>
**Execution autonomy:** <autonomous / interactive>
**App type:** <web / desktop / citrix / N/A>
**App state:** <open-and-ready / user-will-open / skip-discovery / N/A>
**UI targeting:** <agent-builds-you-review / user-indicates / N/A>
**UI capture:** <live-capture / indication-only / N/A>
**Test coverage:** <standard / happy-path / N/A>
**Solution scope:** <SW | local>  <!-- Flow plans only; omit this line for non-Flow plans -->

## Understanding

<2–4 sentences: interpretation of the request, key inputs and outputs, assumptions
or ambiguities resolved during elicitation. Summarize PDD/SDD process steps if one
was provided and note which sections informed each task.>

## Decisions & Trade-offs

- Why this project type
- Why specific skills are loaded in this order
- Trade-offs (e.g., XAML default with C# fallback for specific parts)
- Risks or open questions

## Stop conditions

<Only populate when `Execution autonomy` is `autonomous`. List the concrete hard blockers that MUST interrupt execution — everything else is handled without asking the user. Examples:
- Authentication fails and cannot be recovered without user credentials
- The target application is unresponsive after a reasonable retry window
- A UI element cannot be captured reliably after 3 selector-improvement attempts
- The plan references a file, package, or resource that does not exist and cannot be created
- A pre-existing record would block idempotent execution and cleanup is ambiguous

In `interactive` mode this section is optional — the user is available to resolve ambiguity as it arises.

"Scope feels large", "many tool calls used", "natural pause point", and "partial result looks usable" are NOT stop conditions. If it is not in this list, the executor continues.>

## Task 1: <skill-name> — <short description>

- [ ] <concrete sub-step: action + file paths / activity names / commands>
- [ ] <concrete sub-step: expected outcome or verification>
- [ ] Validate: <compile/build/lint/run check>

## Task 2: <skill-name> — <short description>

- [ ] ...

## Task N: <generation-skill> — Testing (MANDATORY)

> One Testing task per generation skill in the plan (`uipath-rpa`, `uipath-maestro-flow`, `uipath-agents`, `uipath-coded-apps`). Place it immediately after that skill's generation task(s) and **before** any deploy task (`uipath-platform`). Do not describe the testing procedure here — the specialist owns it.

- [ ] Load `<generation-skill>` and run its testing workflow end-to-end at the depth set in the header `Test coverage` field (`standard` or `happy-path`). See that skill's testing references for the exact commands, test-case authoring pattern, and best practices.
- [ ] Testing is **mandatory** for every generation task in this plan — do not skip, do not mark complete without executed tests.
- [ ] Validate: all tests pass; record results and any skipped/failing tests in the plan as blockers.
```

### 5b. Plan quality rules

1. **No placeholders.** Every sub-step has concrete details — activity names, package dependencies, file paths, CLI commands. Never "TBD", "as needed", "similar to Task N".
2. **Granular sub-steps.** One clear action per step.
3. **Checkbox syntax.** `- [ ]` on every sub-step.
4. **End every generation task with a `Validate:` sub-step** — a compile/build/lint check.
4a. **Every plan MUST include a dedicated Testing task per generation skill** (see the `Task N: <generation-skill> — Testing (MANDATORY)` block in Step 5a). The Testing task is **mandatory** — never a `Validate:` sub-step, never optional, never skipped. It routes to the specialist's testing references and does NOT describe the testing procedure.
5. **Capture all Step 1 preferences in the plan header.**
5a. **Autonomous plans MUST include a populated Stop conditions section.** Without concrete stop items, downstream specialists have no way to distinguish "keep going" from "ask the user" and will default to asking — defeating autonomous mode.
6. **Route — do not redescribe.** The plan says WHICH skill to load and IN WHAT ORDER. It does NOT describe the skill's internal flow (target-configuration, OR registration, XAML authoring pipelines, auth flows, **testing procedures / best practices**). Each specialist's own docs own those details.

### 5c. Self-review before saving

1. **Coverage** — Every requirement / PDD step appears in at least one task.
2. **Placeholder scan** — No "TBD", "TODO", "as needed", "if appropriate", "similar to".
3. **Skill order** — Correct specialist per task; skills load in the right order (e.g., RPA before platform deploy; Testing task before deploy).
4. **Validation gaps** — Every generation task ends with a `Validate:` compile/build/lint check.
5. **Testing task present** — A dedicated `Testing (MANDATORY)` task exists for **every** generation skill in the plan (`uipath-rpa`, `uipath-maestro-flow`, `uipath-agents`, `uipath-coded-apps`). The task routes to the specialist's testing references — it does not describe the procedure.
6. **No internal-flow leakage** — The plan does not duplicate steps from any specialist's own references (including testing procedures).

Fix issues before saving.

### 5d. Save location

Save as `YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-name>.md`:

- **Project directory exists** (`project.json`, `flow_files/`, `.uipath/`, or `pyproject.toml`) → save to `docs/plans/` within the project. Create the directory if needed.
- **No project directory** → save to `./plans/` (relative to the current working directory). Create the directory if needed.

### 5e. Present the plan

- **Explore first, then plan:** call EnterPlanMode. User approves → ExitPlanMode.
- **Explore, plan, and execute simultaneously:** emit the plan as text. Main agent starts executing immediately. Do NOT enter plan mode.

## Anti-patterns

1. **Do not skip Step 1** for non-trivial automations.
2. **Do not write automation code or modify the project.** Plans only. In explore-first mode, non-mutating `uip` discovery is allowed.
3. **Do not ask more than 5 questions total.** If still undetermined, plan with best available info.
4. **Do not recommend a skill that contradicts the filesystem signals.** `.flow` files → `uipath-maestro-flow`, not `uipath-rpa`.
5. **Do not skip Step 2.** Check multi-skill patterns before filesystem detection.
6. **Do not ask the UI-targeting question (Step 4) unless the plan includes a UI automation workflow.** Gate on the presence of UI element targeting, NOT on whether `uipath-interact` is loaded — most UI plans are single-skill `uipath-rpa`.
7. **Do not route UI automation through `uipath-interact` for element discovery or selector work.** `uipath-rpa` is the sole workflow authoring skill. `uipath-interact` is only for live-app interaction and post-build verification.
8. **Do not describe specialist-internal flows in the plan** (target-configuration procedures, OR registration, scaffolding/write-agent pipelines, auth steps, pack/publish details). Route to the skill and let it follow its own documentation — inlining those flows creates drift.
9. **Do not save a plan with placeholders** (TBD, TODO, as needed, similar to Task N).
10. **Do not ask the user to choose between XAML and C#.** Project type is inferred from the request (see "Project type: infer first, ask only if vague" in Step 1). RPA workflows are XAML by default. Coded mode is only set when the user explicitly says "coded workflow", "C# workflow", or "create a .cs file" — record the choice directly, no question needed.
11. **Do not surface C# as recommended for routine UI automation.** Form-fill, Type Into, Click, dropdown selection, Excel / email / file work — all bread-and-butter XAML. The default project type for RPA workflows is XAML, full stop. C# coded fallback is an internal `uipath-rpa` decision for individual subtasks, never a top-level recommendation from the planner.
12. **Do not add a third option to the UI-targeting question.** Only two options exist: "I build it, you review it" (default) and "You indicate each element". Never invent a third "build it manually", "I'll do it in Studio", or "skip targeting" option — a developer choosing manual authoring wouldn't be using a coding agent, and adding it creates analysis paralysis for no gain.
13. **Do not leak internal jargon or implementation details into user-facing questions.** Never mention "snapshot", "hand-wire", "AutomationId", "selector candidate", "autonomous capture", "target configuration", "wire up later", or other internal terms. Never expose the runtime / framework / language stack in option labels or descriptions: no "Python agent", "Coded web app", "React / Angular / Vue", "LangGraph / LlamaIndex". Use the product category instead — "AI Agent", "Application", "RPA workflow". Speak in plain developer language: "the live app", "Studio", "elements", "selectors", "inspect", "discover". Implementation details are the specialist skill's concern, not the user's.
14. **Do not inject the user's domain or app name into the question text.** Ask "What kind of application are we automating?" — not "What kind of HR application…". "Is the app open on your machine?" — not "Is the HR app open…". The domain is captured in the plan header; keeping questions generic makes them reusable and prevents the agent from sounding like it's reading back a template.
15. **Do not omit `Execution autonomy` from the plan header, and do not leave `Stop conditions` empty when autonomy is `autonomous`.** Downstream specialists rely on both to decide whether to interrupt. If the user did not answer the autonomy question, default to `autonomous` for simultaneous mode and note that choice in Decisions & Trade-offs. Populate Stop conditions with the hard blockers realistic for this specific plan (auth, app state, element-capture limits, missing resources) — do not leave a generic placeholder.
16. **Do not route new projects to `uipath-rpa-legacy`.** Legacy is for existing .NET Framework 4.6.1 projects only. New projects always go to `uipath-rpa` unless the user explicitly asks for legacy.
17. **Do not omit the mandatory Testing task, and do not inline testing procedures.** Every generation skill in the plan gets its own `Testing (MANDATORY)` task that routes to that skill's testing references. Never replace it with a `Validate:` sub-step, never describe test-case authoring / data-driven testing / mock testing / assertion patterns in the plan — those live in each specialist's own testing guide and will drift if duplicated here.
