# Multi-skill Patterns Guide

Common request shapes that span more than one specialist skill. Use this guide when deciding whether a request is single-skill (load one specialist directly) or multi-skill (emit a plan).

> **Legacy projects:** if the project is legacy (`.NET Framework 4.6.1`, XAML-only, `targetFramework: "Legacy"` or missing in `project.json`), substitute `uipath-rpa-legacy` for `uipath-rpa` in every pattern below.

## When to emit a multi-skill plan

Emit a multi-skill plan when the request clearly spans more than one specialist. Single-skill tasks (e.g., "create a workflow that sends an email") go directly to the specialist — no plan needed.

A request is **multi-skill** when at least one of the following is true:

- Build + deploy crosses skill boundaries (RPA build → platform deploy)
- A target product cannot exist without other products built first (Flow needs RPA processes that don't exist yet)
- The user wants the result of one skill to be consumed by another (Agent uses RPA processes as tools)

A request is **single-skill** when:

- The deliverable is owned end-to-end by one skill (e.g., "create a UiPath RPA workflow that fills a form" — one project, one app, one workflow)
- The user is modifying an existing automation in a single project
- The request is read-only / diagnostic / exploration only

> **Important:** Single-app UI automation (one project, one live app, one workflow) is **not** a multi-skill pattern — it's a single-skill `uipath-rpa` task. `uipath-rpa` owns UI automation authoring end-to-end, including live-app exploration and probing.

## Pattern 1 — RPA build + deploy to Orchestrator

**When it applies:** user wants to build an RPA workflow and deploy it to Orchestrator (most common production flow).

```
1. uipath-rpa      → create / edit, validate, build the workflow
2. uipath-rpa      → testing (mandatory)
3. uipath-solution → pack, publish, deploy to Orchestrator (`uip solution` lifecycle)
```

`uipath-rpa` does not deploy. Deploy to Orchestrator for solution-bundled RPA goes through `uipath-solution` (`uip solution pack/publish/deploy`). For raw single-package Orchestrator ops not wrapped in a `.uipx`, defer to `uipath-platform`.

## Pattern 2 — Flow with local resources

**When it applies:** Flow and the components it orchestrates are peer sibling projects under one `.uipx` solution at the current working directory. Each component is scaffolded as part of this plan (or replaced by a placeholder contract when not built here). The flow runs locally / publishes to Studio Web per the plan's `Solution scope`.

```
1. uipath-maestro-flow   → create solution, init flow project
2. <skill per component> → fan out: one task per component, routed by type
                           (rpa → uipath-rpa; agent → uipath-agents; app → uipath-coded-apps)
3. <skill per component> → testing for each component (mandatory)
4. uipath-maestro-flow   → wire all components, validate, finalize per `Solution scope`
5. uipath-maestro-flow   → testing for the flow (mandatory)
```

`<component skill>` is `uipath-rpa`, `uipath-agents`, or `uipath-coded-apps` depending on the component type.

## Pattern 3 — Flow with deployed resources

**When it applies:** Flow references components that exist as standalone Orchestrator tenant resources — already published, or to be published as part of this session. The flow consumes them by tenant identity, not as peer sibling projects under a local solution.

```
1. <component skill>   → scaffold any unbuilt component
2. <component skill>   → testing for the component (mandatory)
3. uipath-solution     → deploy the component to Orchestrator via `uip solution` (RPA always needs uipath-solution; agents / coded-apps self-deploy)
4. uipath-maestro-flow → design and wire the flow against the published components, validate, finalize per `Solution scope`
5. uipath-maestro-flow → testing for the flow (mandatory)
```

## Pattern 4 — Flow deploy to Orchestrator

**When it applies:** the flow exists; user wants it deployed to Orchestrator (not Studio Web).

```
1. uipath-maestro-flow → validate, `uip flow pack`
2. uipath-maestro-flow → testing (mandatory)
3. uipath-solution     → publish and deploy to Orchestrator via `uip solution`
```

`uipath-maestro-flow` follows the plan's `Solution scope` (SW or local); Orchestrator deploy of the wrapping solution requires `uipath-solution`.

## Pattern 5 — Agent that uses RPA processes as tools

**When it applies:** the request is for an agent whose tools are RPA processes that need to be created and published.

```
1. uipath-rpa      → create and validate the RPA process(es) the agent will call
2. uipath-rpa      → testing for the RPA processes (mandatory)
3. uipath-solution → deploy the RPA process(es) to Orchestrator via `uip solution`
4. uipath-agents   → create the agent, bind the published processes as tools
5. uipath-agents   → testing for the agent (mandatory)
6. uipath-agents   → deploy
```

## Pattern routing for PDD-driven lane

When deriving tasks from an SDD, the planner picks a pattern based on the SDD's project list:

| SDD shape | Pattern(s) used |
|---|---|
| Single RPA project, no deploy mention | Pattern: simple `uipath-rpa` build + testing |
| Single RPA project, deploy to Orchestrator | Pattern 1 |
| RPA Master Project (multiple sub-projects, queue-connected) | Pattern 1 applied per sub-project, then cross-project deploy via `uipath-solution` (single `.uipx`) |
| Solution with Flow + RPA + Agents, components built fresh in this session | Pattern 2 expanded across all included products |
| Solution with Flow consuming pre-published Orchestrator resources | Pattern 3 |
| Solution overview SDD | Compose multiple patterns; respect cross-product integration order from §Cross-Project Data Flow |
| API Workflow (single product) | API Workflow specialist + `uipath-solution` for deploy + testing |
| Agent with RPA tools in §3 Tools | Pattern 5 |

Cross-project integration order (general rule): **dependencies before dependents**. Build callable resources (RPA processes, API Workflows, agents-as-tools) before the products that consume them (Flows, Cases, parent agents).

## Pattern composition for Solutions

Solution-scope SDDs produce a unified project list. The planner walks the list and emits one pattern segment per project, then sequences them so that integrated components are built before their consumers:

1. Build all leaf resources (libraries, callable API Workflows, RPA processes used as agent tools).
2. Run testing for each leaf.
3. Deploy leaf resources to Orchestrator.
4. Build orchestrators (Flows, parent agents, Cases) using the published leaf references.
5. Run testing for each orchestrator.
6. Deploy orchestrators.
7. End-to-end validation.

## Anti-patterns

1. **Splitting a single-app UI automation into a "discovery" task plus an "authoring" task.** `uipath-rpa` owns end-to-end authoring including target configuration and live-app exploration. One task, one skill.
2. **Skipping the dedicated Testing task per generation skill.** Testing is mandatory and lives at the patterns level — every generation step in every pattern is followed by a testing step.
3. **Deploying via `uipath-rpa` or `uipath-maestro-flow`.** Deployment of `.uipx`-wrapped solutions to Orchestrator goes through `uipath-solution` (`uip solution pack/publish/deploy`); for non-solution single-package Orchestrator ops, defer to `uipath-platform`. The build skills do not deploy.
4. **Building Flow nodes that reference resources before the resources exist.** Use Pattern 2 (local resources, mocked then wired) or Pattern 3 (build and deploy components first, then reference). Never reference an unpublished resource by ID.
