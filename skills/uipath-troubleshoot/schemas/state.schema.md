## Investigation Guides

Resolved by triage. Always includes the generic guide (`references/investigation_guide.md`). Includes the product-specific guide if one exists. Other agents read these paths directly — they do NOT scan the references folder themselves.

## Matched Playbooks

Resolved by triage. Full paths to every playbook that matches the symptoms, with per-playbook signal-match data.

Fields per entry:

- `path` — relative path to the playbook from the skill root.
- `confidence` — the playbook's frontmatter confidence (`high | medium | low`). **This is a cap on how decisively the playbook can pin a root cause when matched** — `high` means the playbook describes a specific error with a known cause; `medium` means concrete troubleshooting steps but the conclusion depends on inspection of uncertain fields; `low` provides general context. **Confidence is not a ranking input — see signal_match_count.** Do NOT modify the frontmatter confidence.
- `signal_match_count` — integer count of how many distinct signature signals from the playbook's `## Context` and `## Investigation` sections the gathered evidence actually satisfies. A signal is a discrete fact: an exception class, a specific error code, a verbatim error fragment, an entity-state assertion, a package version, an activity-instance label, etc.
- `signals_matched` — array of short labels naming each signal that was satisfied (audit trail for `signal_match_count`).

**Ranking.** Matched playbooks are ordered by `signal_match_count` DESCENDING — highest specificity first, regardless of frontmatter confidence. A `medium`-confidence playbook with 3 matched signals ranks above a `high`-confidence playbook with 1 matched signal. The hypothesis generator drafts H1 from the top-ranked playbook, H2 from the second-ranked, etc. Ties on signal count are broken by frontmatter confidence (`high > medium > low`).

**Three categories of evidence-vs-playbook relationship:**

- **Positively supported** (`signal_match_count >= 1`) → list in `matched_playbooks`.
- **Silent** (evidence neither supports nor contradicts any of the playbook's signals) → do NOT list. The playbook is uninformed by the available evidence; it cannot be tested productively until more data exists.
- **Contradicted** (evidence directly disproves at least one CORE signal of the playbook signature) → do NOT list in `matched_playbooks`; instead record in `eliminated_playbooks` with the contradicting evidence. The hypothesis generator will not draft hypotheses from these.

A "core signal" is one named in the playbook's `## Context` or `## Investigation` as a required precondition for the cause to apply (e.g., a "resource absent / HTTP 404" assertion, a "credential mismatch" assertion, an "invalid resource state" assertion). Surface-level signals shared across siblings (a generic "<activity> failed" category) are NOT core signals — they're descriptors, not preconditions.

## Eliminated Playbooks

Playbooks whose signature was contradicted by triage evidence. Each entry records:

- `path` — playbook path.
- `contradicting_signal` — short sentence naming the playbook's required signal AND the contradicting evidence (e.g., "playbook requires the resource absent; evidence shows the resource exists in the resolved scope").

The hypothesis generator MUST exclude these from consideration. The depth-verifier MUST NOT confirm a hypothesis that maps to an eliminated playbook.

**Why count over confidence.** Multiple playbooks can match the same surface signal (e.g., a generic "<activity> failed" category that several sibling playbooks under one package all carry at frontmatter `high`). Ranking purely on frontmatter confidence then surfaces multi-way false positives at HIGH. Counting actual signal hits per playbook discriminates between them: the one whose specific signature is most fully satisfied by the evidence wins. Frontmatter confidence still caps the root-cause certainty downstream (`high` matches can fast-path; `medium`/`low` require deeper testing) — but it does not decide ordering.

## Plan

The investigation plan is the agent's single, growing record of everything it intends to do. Triage starts with a one-step plan (classify the user's message) and appends steps as data arrives. **The plan IS the procedure** — there is no pre-plan or post-plan phase; every action the agent takes is a plan step that is recorded, executed, and audited.

Field semantics:

- `n` — step order (1-indexed; numbering grows as steps are appended).
- `action` — what the agent will do at this step. Action shapes:
  - **Tool call** — an exact CLI command (with output capture), or `read <path>` for a file read.
  - **User interaction** — `ask user: <question>` (free-text) or `ask user (select): <opt> | <opt> | …` (multi-choice surfaced via `AskUserQuestion`).
  - **Reasoning** — a named decision the agent records without calling a tool: `classify (system, entity) from user message`, `re-evaluate scope against gathered evidence`, `match playbooks against in-scope summaries`, etc. The agent's reasoning + result is captured in `purpose` / step output.
- `purpose` — the specific signal or decision the step yields (one short phrase).
- `feeds` — which downstream step or decision consumes the result.
- `revise_if` — observed-field condition that mutates the remaining plan (add/drop steps). Empty if the step is unconditional.
- `status` — `pending | done | skipped`.

**The plan is revisable.** After each step the agent evaluates `revise_if` against the observed data, then appends/modifies remaining steps. If the just-completed step yields information that requires new steps not anticipated by any `revise_if` (a genuine discovery), the agent appends them with a one-line `purpose` before executing. The agent runs ONLY plan steps — never a freestyle command.

**Boundaries on what can appear in a plan:**

- No open-ended enumeration steps (no "search every folder", no tenant-wide sweep). Locate passes are single bounded calls with at least one filter (state, time window, or named anchor).
- No `get <unknown-id>` actions for entities that have not been located. A `get` step requires the id to be resolved by an earlier step.
- No undocumented commands. Every tool-call step must run a command documented in the matched investigation guide or the matched playbook's `## Investigation` section.
- A single Pass 2 extension is permitted when the initial pass yields weak matches; a Pass 3 is not.

The plan structure is reusable: any sub-agent that gathers data (triage, hypothesis-tester) writes a plan of its own. For the hypothesis-tester, the plan is stored on the hypothesis itself (`hypotheses.json` → per-hypothesis `test_plan`), not on `state.json`.

## Requirements

Generic key-value store for data gathered during the investigation. Any agent can read it; triage and orchestrator write to it.

- Keys are freeform — use descriptive names (e.g., `scope_id`, `source_code_path`, `entity_name`)
- Values are whatever was collected (string, number, etc.)
- The hypothesis-tester writes `source_code_path` here when it resolves the project path (see `agents/hypothesis-tester.md` § Source-code availability check); triage and the orchestrator write the rest.

## Rules

- Triage sub-agent creates this file and resolves investigation guides, matched playbooks, and requirements
- Other agents read paths from `state.json` — they do NOT browse `references/` themselves (exception: triage, scope-checker, depth-verifier, and presenter browse references — see `shared.md` invariant 3)
- Orchestrator updates `phase` as the investigation progresses
- Any agent can read `requirements`; triage and orchestrator write to it, and the hypothesis-tester writes `requirements.source_code_path`
- The `scope` may be updated by the orchestrator when scope adjustment occurs
