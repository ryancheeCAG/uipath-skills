# Response Mapping Mismatch (DAP-RT-1005 / DAP-RT-1155 / DAP-RT-1156)

## Context

What this looks like — the provider call succeeded but IS could not map the response into the activity's output type:

| Code | Name | Specific cause |
|---|---|---|
| `DAP-RT-1005` | ApiResponseMismatch | Response shape doesn't match the activity's output type — connector schema drift |
| `DAP-RT-1155` | DataTableFieldTypeMismatch | A response field's type doesn't match the expected TypedDataTable column |
| `DAP-RT-1156` | TypedDataTableNotConstructedProperly | Output could not be assembled into the expected TypedDataTable |

What can cause it:
- The connector's response schema changed (provider API version drift) but the workflow's activity package is older
- The activity's declared output type no longer matches what the provider returns
- A field returned as a different type than the TypedDataTable column expects (e.g. string where a number is mapped)

What to look for:
- `IsServiceError: false` — the failure is IS-side mapping, not a provider error (the call returned data)
- The activity package version vs the current connector schema (drift is the usual cause of `1005`)
- `ProviderErrorMessage` is typically absent — the provider returned 200; mapping failed afterward

## Investigation

1. **Confirm it is a mapping failure, not a provider error** — `IsServiceError` should be `false` and there should be no `ProviderErrorCode`. If a provider status is present, use [request-failed.md](./request-failed.md).
2. **Read the connection resource file** — identify the connector and connection (see "Connection Resource File" in [overview.md](../overview.md)).
3. `uip is resources describe <connector-key> <object-name>` — get the current field definitions and compare against the activity's declared output type.
4. `uip is activities list <connector-key>` — check whether the activity/package version in the project lags the current connector schema.

## Resolution

- **`DAP-RT-1005` — schema drift:** update the connector activity package in the project to the version that matches the current response schema, then re-map the output and republish.
- **`DAP-RT-1155` — field type mismatch:** correct the TypedDataTable column type to match the field returned by `uip is resources describe`, or transform the field before mapping.
- **`DAP-RT-1156`:** re-create the output mapping from the current schema so the TypedDataTable is constructed from valid columns.
- If the provider genuinely changed its contract, align the activity configuration to the new schema rather than forcing the old mapping.
