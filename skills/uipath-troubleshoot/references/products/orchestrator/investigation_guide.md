# Orchestrator Investigation Guide

## Data Correlation

Before fetching ANY job, queue, or asset data, resolve identity first:

1. **Folder** — resolve the folder key (GUID). All Orchestrator data is folder-scoped. Use `uip or folders list` to find all accessible folders (Personal, Solution, and Standard) — the default view is scoped to the current user. Use `uip or folders list --all` only when you need every folder in the tenant (filtering and sorting flags require `--all`). Use `uip or folders get <key-or-path>` to confirm details. If the folder is inaccessible, STOP — nothing else will be valid without it. **After resolving the folder, verify it contains the target entity** (e.g., run `uip or jobs get <key>` or a scoped query for the expected process/queue). If the target entity is not found in the resolved folder, try other folders from `folders list` before continuing. Do NOT proceed with a folder that returns empty results for the target entity.
2. **Process** — identify the process name (from user input, working directory `project.json`, or package name). All subsequent queries filter by this process.
3. **Time window** — establish the relevant period from the user's report.

Only after identity is resolved, fetch data and verify every result against it:

- **Process/Release** — job release name matches the identified process
- **Queue** — queue name matches what the user reported (if queue-related)
- **Robot/Machine** — if the user mentioned a specific robot or machine, verify the data belongs to it
- **Timestamps** — fall within the established time window

If data doesn't match: **discard it**. Do NOT fetch details for jobs or items from other processes. Do NOT use unrelated data as a proxy. Report the mismatch and ask for clarification.

4. **Job selection** — if multiple jobs exist for the identified process, present the list to the user (showing state, timestamp, error summary) and ask which one to investigate. If the user said "latest" or didn't specify, default to the most recent faulted job and state this assumption explicitly. Do NOT fetch details for multiple jobs — investigate one at a time.
5. **Queue item** — if the issue is queue-related, resolve the queue and item. Use `uip resource queues list --folder-key <key> --name <name>` to find the queue definition key. If the user provided a queue item key, use `uip resource queue-items get <item-key> --folder-key <key>` to confirm it exists and extract the queue name, error details, and retry status. If the queue item is not found in the first folder, try other folders from `folders list`.

## Job Data Bundle

For every job under investigation, gather these in order. Write each to `raw/` immediately.

1. **Job details** — `uip or jobs get <key>` — state, input/output arguments, timing, machine info, error details
2. **Job logs** — `uip or jobs logs <key>` — robot execution logs, newest-first. Folder is inferred from the job key. Use `--level Error` to quickly find errors. Use `--limit` to control how many entries (default 50)
3. **Job history** — `uip or jobs history <key>` — job state transition history (timestamps for each state change: Pending → Running → Faulted). Useful for identifying delays and lifecycle issues.
4. **Job traces** — `uip or jobs traces <key>` — job execution traces (activity states, variable snapshots, execution path). Available for all job types.

This is the baseline. Domain-specific data gathering builds on it — see the investigation guide for each matched domain (UI Automation, Integration Service, Maestro) for additional steps after the baseline.

## Queue Item Data Bundle

For every queue item under investigation, gather these in order. Write each to `raw/` immediately.

1. **Resolve queue** — `uip resource queues list --folder-key <key> --name <name>` — find the queue definition and its key
2. **Queue item details** — `uip resource queue-items get <item-key> --folder-key <key>` — status, SpecificContent, processingException, retry count
3. **Queue item history** — `uip resource queue-items get-history <item-key> --folder-key <key>` — state transitions with timestamps (New → InProgress → Failed/Retried)
4. **Last retry** — `uip resource queue-items get-last-retry <item-key> --folder-key <key>` — details of the most recent retry attempt

For comparison investigations (e.g., queue-items-failing playbook), also gather successful items:

5. **List failed items** — `uip resource queue-items list --queue-key <queue-key> --folder-key <key> --status Failed` — all failed items for comparison
6. **List successful items** — `uip resource queue-items list --queue-key <queue-key> --folder-key <key> --status Successful --top 3` — sample of successful items to compare SpecificContent

## Finding Related Jobs

When investigating service tasks, child jobs, or multi-job processes, use `jobs list` to find related jobs:

```
uip or jobs list --folder-key <folder-key> --process-name <name> --created-after <start> --created-before <end> --output json
```

Key flags (all optional, but `--folder-key` or `--folder-path` is required):
- `--folder-key <key>` — folder GUID (required, or use `--folder-path`)
- `--state <state>` — filter by state: Pending, Running, Successful, Faulted, Stopped, Stopping, Suspended, Resumed, Terminating
- `--process-name <name>` — filter by process name (contains match)
- `--created-after <datetime>` / `--created-before <datetime>` — narrow to a time window (ISO 8601)

Use this to find child jobs spawned by Maestro service tasks, or to identify other faulted jobs for the same process around the same time.

## Testing Prerequisites

When testing hypotheses for Orchestrator issues, gather and verify these before drawing conclusions:

1. **Folder context** — confirm the folder the process runs in; permissions, jobs and assets are folder-scoped
2. **Process version** — confirm the deployed package version matches what the user expects
3. **Robot assignment** — verify the robot/machine template is assigned to the folder and has capacity
4. **Execution logs** — use job traces/logs to reconstruct the actual execution path, don't infer from job status alone
5. **Timing** — check job start/end times, queue transaction durations, and trigger schedules against reported symptoms
6. **Dependencies** — check `## Dependencies` in `overview.md` for cross-product issues (e.g., Identity Server, Elasticsearch, SQL Server)
