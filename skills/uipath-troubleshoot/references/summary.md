# Troubleshooting Reference Router

Start here. Find the product or package that matches the user's issue, then follow the links to drill down into playbooks.

## Orchestrator

Manages automation resources, robots, processes, and execution. Handles job scheduling, queue management, asset storage, triggers, storage buckets, and folder-based access control. Issues here involve failed jobs, stuck jobs, queue item failures, trigger problems, robot connectivity, permissions, and platform availability.

CLI: `uip or --help`

- [products/orchestrator/overview.md](./products/orchestrator/overview.md) — Product overview, features, and dependencies
- [products/orchestrator/summary.md](./products/orchestrator/summary.md) — All playbooks for Orchestrator issues

## Runtime Exceptions

General .NET runtime exceptions originating from the user's own workflow code — not from activity packages or platform internals. Covers null references, null arguments, and similar errors in workflow logic, variable handling, and data processing.

- [runtime-exceptions/overview.md](./runtime-exceptions/overview.md) — Scope boundary, investigation sources (local logs and Orchestrator jobs)
- [runtime-exceptions/summary.md](./runtime-exceptions/summary.md) — All playbooks for runtime exception issues

## Maestro

CLI: `uip maestro --help`

Agentic orchestration platform built on Orchestrator. BPMN-based process design with human-in-the-loop tasks, AI agent tasks, and service tasks. Processes are designed in Studio Web, deployed as solutions, and managed through Maestro Instance Management. Issues here involve deployment failures, debug-vs-deploy mismatches, expression/variable errors, file handling, boundary events, parallel markers, stuck instances, and service availability.

- [products/maestro/overview.md](./products/maestro/overview.md) — Product overview, dependencies, key concepts, and features
- [products/maestro/summary.md](./products/maestro/summary.md) — All playbooks for Maestro issues

## Integration Service

Connector platform for third-party integrations (Salesforce, Outlook, SAP, Slack, etc.). Manages OAuth connections, exposes activities for automations and BPMN processes, and provides event-based triggers. Issues here involve connection failures, expired authentication, triggers not firing, and operation errors. Connection errors from Integration Service often surface through Maestro or Orchestrator as the calling product.

CLI: `uip is --help`

- [products/integration-service/overview.md](./products/integration-service/overview.md) — Product overview, connectors, connections, and CLI commands
- [products/integration-service/summary.md](./products/integration-service/summary.md) — All playbooks for Integration Service issues

## Agents

Low-code agents built with `uip agent`. Issues here involve LLM call failures, context grounding index misconfigurations, and input schema validation errors. Primary investigation surface: `uip traces spans get <traceId> --output json` — spans carry the full error text including error codes and field-level detail.

CLI: `uip agent run status`, `uip traces spans get`, `uip agent context`, `uip context-grounding`, `uip agent validate`, `uip agent publish`

- [products/agents/summary.md](./products/agents/summary.md) — All playbooks for Agents issues

## LLM Gateway

Service that routes agent / product LLM calls to a model — platform default or tenant-owned (BYO) provider key. Issues here involve BYO LLM product configurations failing at runtime, server-side validation probes failing on `create` / `update`, and routing being bypassed (call hits the platform default despite an active BYO record). LLM Gateway failures often surface through the consuming agent / product (agents, agenthub, jarvis, IXP) or as auth-shaped errors referencing the vendor directly (OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Bedrock, Vertex, Anthropic). The gateway does **not** expose per-request invocation logs via CLI — diagnosis is current-state + trace-evidence only.

CLI: `uip llm-configuration --help`, `uip traces spans get`, `uip gov aops-policy deployed-policy resolve`

- [products/llm-gateway/overview.md](./products/llm-gateway/overview.md) — Service model, dependencies, CLI surface, and what the CLI does NOT expose
- [products/llm-gateway/summary.md](./products/llm-gateway/summary.md) — All playbooks for LLM Gateway / BYO LLM issues

## UI Automation

Activities for interacting with desktop and web application UIs. Robots use selectors (XML descriptors) to find and interact with UI elements. Issues here involve selector failures, element not found exceptions, timeout issues, Healing Agent problems, and data validation errors during UI interactions.

- [activity-packages/ui-automation/summary.md](./activity-packages/ui-automation/summary.md) — All playbooks for UI Automation issues

## System Activities

Core workflow activities from `UiPath.System.Activities` that interact with Orchestrator resources at runtime — asset retrieval, credential lookup, queue operations, and storage buckets. Issues here involve asset-not-found errors, permission denied, folder scope mismatches, external vault failures, and package version bugs.

## Classic Activities

The classic (non-"modern"/non-"Next") activities under `UiPath.Core.Activities`. Two groups: classic UI Automation — `Click`, `Type Into`, `Send Hotkey`, `Open Browser`, `Close Tab`, `Open Application`, `Attach Browser`/`Window`, `Take Screenshot`, `Wait Image Vanish`, `Wait UI Element Appear` (selector/image based, `SelectorNotFoundException` / `ActivityTimeoutException` / `ElementOperationException` / `BrowserOperationException`); and System/Core — `Invoke Workflow File`, `Invoke Code`, `Add Queue Item`, `Rename File`, `Move File`, `Append Line`, `Log Message`, `Kill Process`, `Start Triggers`, `For Each Row` (file/process/code/queue/workflow failures). Use this package when the faulted activity is one of the classic types above. For the modern UI "Next" activities (`NClick`, `Use Application/Browser`, Healing Agent) use **UI Automation**; for `Get Asset`/`Get Credential`/`Get Robot Asset` use **System Activities**.

## Excel Activities

Desktop Excel activities from `UiPath.Excel.Activities` — read, write, delete, and manipulate `.xlsx` / `.xls` workbooks, run VBA macros (`Invoke VBA`, `Execute Macro`), and look up ranges on the host filesystem via Excel COM (Excel installed) or the OpenXML provider (Excel not required). Issues here involve workbooks locked by other processes, sheet names not found, range parsing failures, provider-specific parsing errors on heavily formatted or sensitivity-labeled files, Trust Center macro blocks, entry-method / parameter marshaling errors, COM-interop instability (`0x80010100 RPC_E_SYS_CALL_FAILED` and related HRESULTs), and Application Scope / Use Excel File container failures. For cloud Excel via Microsoft Graph, see Microsoft Office 365 Activities above.

## Word Activities

Activities for automating Microsoft Word documents on Windows. Operations run inside a `Use Word File` (`WordProcessScope`) or classic `Word Application Scope` container and drive a real WINWORD.EXE through Office Interop (COM), requiring desktop Word on the execution host. Issues span package-wide COM / host failures common to all Word activities (type library / class not registered `0x8002801D` / `0x80040154` / `REGDB_E_CLASSNOTREG`, bitness mismatch, Word busy/blocked `0x8001010A`, `WINWORD.EXE` crashing mid-operation with `RPC_E_WRONG_THREAD` `0x8001010E`); `Word Application Scope` failures (corrupted-file errors, indefinite hangs on background modal dialogs, "cannot create unknown type" load errors, document-path resolution); and `Add Picture` (`WordAddImage`)-specific failures (activity placed outside a Word scope, insertion target text/bookmark not found, invalid image path / unusable image input).

## Database Activities

Activities for querying and modifying relational databases over ADO.NET (SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, ODBC, OLE DB). A `DatabaseConnection` opened by `Connect to Database` / `Start Transaction` is consumed by `Execute Query`, `Execute Non Query`, `Run Command`, and the bulk/insert activities. Issues here involve null/out-of-scope connections, provider/driver mismatches after Windows-Legacy → Windows migration, SQL syntax / unsafe concatenation, query text in the connection-string field, command timeouts, `0xE0434352` CLR crashes, and using the wrong activity for the statement type.

## Playbooks

All playbooks use the same headers: `## Context`, `## Investigation` (optional), `## Resolution` (optional). They vary by confidence level:

| Confidence | What you know | Investigation | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| **High** | Exact error → exact cause | Quick verification | "GetAsset" error → asset missing |
| **Medium** | Specific error → known troubleshooting path | Concrete steps | SSL cert invalid → check cert, chain, trust |
| **Low** | General symptoms → multiple causes | General guidance or absent | Robot unresponsive → could be heartbeat, network, or machine issue |
