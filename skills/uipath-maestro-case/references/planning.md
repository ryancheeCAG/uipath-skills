# Phase 1 — Planning: sdd.md → tasks.md

Generate reviewable task plan (`tasks.md`) from design document (`sdd.md`). Discovers registry resources, resolves task type IDs, produces declarative specification that downstream execution phases (Phase 2 Prototyping → Phase 3 Implementation → Phase 4 Validate → Phase 5 Debug → Phase 6 Publish) consume via direct JSON writes to `caseplan.json`. See [implementation.md](implementation.md) for execution detail and [phased-execution.md](phased-execution.md) for phase contracts.

> **Output:** `tasks/tasks.md` + `tasks/registry-resolved.json` in the same directory as the sdd.md file. When SLA escalations are present, also `tasks/recipients-resolved.json` — see [`plugins/sla/planning.md` § Identity Resolution](plugins/sla/planning.md#identity-resolution).
>
> **Exit gate:** User must explicitly approve `tasks.md` before Phase 2 begins.

> **Per-node-type detail lives in plugins.** This document covers the cross-cutting planning workflow. For how to fill fields for a specific node, consult the relevant plugin:

## Step 0 — Resolve the `uip` binary

`uip` is installed via npm. Resolve the binary (it may not be on PATH in nvm environments), capture its version, and upgrade only when the installed version is **older** than the latest published `@uipath/cli` — dev builds may be newer than the npm release, leave those alone:

```bash
UIP=$(command -v uip 2>/dev/null || echo "$(npm root -g 2>/dev/null | sed 's|/node_modules$||')/bin/uip")
CURRENT=$($UIP --version 2>/dev/null | awk '{print $NF}')
LATEST=$(npm view @uipath/cli version 2>/dev/null)
OLDEST=$(printf '%s\n%s\n' "$LATEST" "$CURRENT" | sort -V | head -n1)
if [ -z "$CURRENT" ] || { [ "$CURRENT" != "$LATEST" ] && [ "$OLDEST" = "$CURRENT" ]; }; then
  npm install -g @uipath/cli@latest
  UIP=$(command -v uip 2>/dev/null || echo "$(npm root -g 2>/dev/null | sed 's|/node_modules$||')/bin/uip")
fi
$UIP --version
```

Use `$UIP` in place of `uip` for all subsequent commands if the plain `uip` command isn't found.

If `npm install -g` fails with a permission error, prompt the user to re-run it with the appropriate privileges (e.g., `sudo npm install -g @uipath/cli@latest`) — do not retry automatically.

## Step 1 — Check login and pull registry

Registry discovery happens during planning, so login is required first.

```bash
uip login status --output json
uip maestro case registry pull
```

If not logged in, prompt the user to log in. The registry pull caches all resources locally at `~/.uip/case-resources/` so subsequent searches are local disk lookups.

**Capture `Data.BaseUrl` from the `login status` JSON for Step 2.1 tenant-override detection.** If `login status` failed or the field is absent, treat tenant override as unavailable and let Step 2.1 fall through to prompt-phrase detection — do not re-run `login status`.

## Step 2 — Locate and parse the design document

Accept the `sdd.md` file path from the user, or ask if not provided. When the directory contains multiple `.md` files, use **AskUserQuestion** with the candidates + "Something else" to disambiguate.

If the resolved path has **no `sdd.md`**, skill enters Phase 0 (interview mode) before this step. See [phase-0-interview.md](phase-0-interview.md). Phase 1 resumes here only after the Approve hard-stop in Phase 0.

`sdd.md` is the **sole input**. It describes stages, tasks, edges, conditions, SLA, component types, persona information, and provides the search keywords for registry lookups. The skill does not validate or gap-fill sdd.md — trust it as written. (Phase 0 may have generated it; once approved, Rule 2 applies regardless of source.)

> **Phase 0 carryover.** When Phase 0 ran, `tasks/registry-resolved.json` already contains user-confirmed registry picks. During Step 3 below, **read the existing file first**: skip re-search for entries already resolved, only run discovery for tasks Phase 0 deferred (`<UNRESOLVED>` markers in `sdd.md`). Append new resolutions to the same file.

### Step 2.1 — Detect schema version (Rule 18)

Resolution order (first match wins):

#### 2.1.a — Tenant override (alpha environment)

Read the `Data.BaseUrl` value captured from Step 1's `uip login status --output json` call. If the value equals `https://alpha.uipath.com` (exact case-sensitive string match, no trailing slash), schema is `v20` regardless of user prompt. Print plain-text confirmation BEFORE Step 3 begins:

```
> Schema: v20 (alpha tenant override — BaseUrl=https://alpha.uipath.com forces v20 regardless of prompt phrasing). Phase 4 informational; CLI validate / upload / debug may reject downstream.
```

Skip Step 2.1.b. The override is **forced** — user prompt phrases cannot downgrade to v19 from an alpha tenant.

If `Data.BaseUrl` is absent (login failed, field missing, different value), proceed to Step 2.1.b. Do NOT halt — login state is independent of schema selection.

#### 2.1.b — User-prompt phrase

Scan **only the user message that activated the skill** (the prompt that matched the skill description). Match case-insensitive substrings:

| Phrase (any one matches) |
|---|
| `v20 schema` |
| `schema v20` |
| `use v20` |
| `emit v20` |
| `generate v20` |
| `unified schema` |
| `schema 20.0.0` |

- **Match** → schema is `v20`. Print plain-text confirmation BEFORE Step 3 begins:
  ```
  > Schema: v20 (skill-emit-only mode — Phase 4 informational; CLI validate / upload / debug may reject downstream)
  ```
- **No match** → schema is `v19` (default). No confirmation line.

**Never** scan sdd.md content, file paths, registry-resolved.json, Phase 0 transcripts, or any subsequent user message. Detection happens once, at Phase 1 entry. If the user wants to switch schema mid-build, they must re-run the skill from Phase 1 (Rule 6). The tenant override (2.1.a) is also fixed at Phase 1 entry — switching tenants mid-build does not change `tasks.md`'s `Schema:` header.

### Step 2.2 — Persist schema choice in tasks.md header

When `tasks.md` is written at Step 4, the **first non-comment line** is the schema header:

```markdown
Schema: v19
```

or

```markdown
Schema: v20
```

Place this line above all `T<n>` headings. Re-entry protocol (Phase 3 Step 9.6, Phase 4) re-reads tasks.md per Rule 7 and recovers the schema choice from this header. caseplan.json self-identifies via its top-level `version` literal as a secondary check.

If the schema header in tasks.md conflicts with an already-written caseplan.json's `version` field at re-entry, **halt with explicit error** — never silently re-flip.

## Step 3 — Resolve resources

Before resource resolution, seed TodoWrite with the items below to track Phase 1 progress through registry lookups and §4 T-entry emit. Mark each `in_progress` on entry, `completed` on exit. One item per emit class — never per T-entry.

1. Resolve registry resources (this Step 3)
2. Write case file T01 (§4.2)
3. Write trigger entries T02+ (§4.3)
4. Write variable / argument entries (§4.2.1)
5. Write stage entries (§4.4)
6. Write edge entries (§4.5)
7. Write task entries (§4.6)
8. Write condition entries (§4.7)
9. Write SLA entries (§4.8)
10. User approves tasks.md (Step 5)

For every task, trigger, and condition in the sdd.md:

1. **Identify the plugin** by matching the sdd.md component description to an entry in the catalogs below (§3.1–§3.3).
2. **Load the plugin's `planning.md`** — it lists the exact fields to resolve from sdd.md, the cache file(s) to consult, and any discovery steps required.
3. **Apply registry discovery** via [registry-discovery.md](registry-discovery.md) when a taskTypeId is needed.
4. **Persist every resolution** to `registry-resolved.json` (search query, all matched results, selected result, rationale). Keep full detail for debugging.

### 3.1 Task Type catalog

> **Closed enum — 9 values.** sdd.md `Type:` and caseplan.json `type` field both use the schema-kebab values in column 1. Plugin folder name (column 2) is what to open during planning + execution; it is NOT what gets written into JSON. See SKILL.md Rule 16 + Plugin Index naming-asymmetry note. Any value outside this set (`external-agent`, `connector-activity`, `wait-for-event`, etc.) is invalid — write a `<UNRESOLVED>` placeholder instead.

| sdd.md `Type:` / caseplan.json `type` | Plugin folder |
|---|---|
| `process` (covers `AGENTIC_PROCESS` legacy label) | `plugins/tasks/process/` |
| `agent` | `plugins/tasks/agent/` |
| `rpa` | `plugins/tasks/rpa/` |
| `action` | `plugins/tasks/action/` |
| `api-workflow` | `plugins/tasks/api-workflow/` |
| `case-management` | `plugins/tasks/case-management/` |
| `execute-connector-activity` | `plugins/tasks/connector-activity/` |
| `wait-for-connector` | `plugins/tasks/connector-trigger/` |
| `wait-for-timer` | `plugins/tasks/wait-for-timer/` |

### 3.2 Trigger Type catalog (case-level)

| sdd.md description | Plugin |
|--------------------|--------|
| "Start manually" / "User initiates" | `plugins/triggers/manual/` |
| "Every N hours/days" / scheduled / cron-like | `plugins/triggers/timer/` |
| Event from external system (connector-based) | `plugins/triggers/event/` |

### 3.3 Condition Scope catalog

| Where the condition attaches | Plugin |
|------------------------------|--------|
| On stage entry | `plugins/conditions/stage-entry-conditions/` |
| On stage exit | `plugins/conditions/stage-exit-conditions/` |
| On task entry | `plugins/conditions/task-entry-conditions/` |
| On case exit | `plugins/conditions/case-exit-conditions/` |

> **Connector-bound condition rules.** Any of the 4 condition scopes above can carry a rule whose WHEN is `wait-for-connector` — binding an Integration Service connector event to gate the condition. These rules require the same connector-resolution pipeline as a task-class `wait-for-connector` (TypeCache + `case spec --type trigger` + reference-resolution). Plan-step planners MUST collect connector fields (`type-id`, `connector-key`, `connection-id`, `object-name`, `event-operation`, `event-mode`, `input-values`, optional `filter`, optional `outputs`) in the condition's T-entry alongside the standard `display-name` / `rule-type` / `condition-expression` fields. Shared recipe: [`connector-trigger-common.md § Target: connector-bound condition rule`](connector-trigger-common.md#target-connector-bound-condition-rule); per-scope tasks.md format in each condition plugin's `planning.md`.

### 3.4 Unresolved resources

When a resource cannot be resolved (registry gap and no cache match, or missing connection), **do not fabricate a placeholder or mock**. Instead:

1. Mark the line in `tasks.md` with `<UNRESOLVED: <reason>>` in the `taskTypeId` / `typeId` / `connectionId` slot.
2. **Omit `inputs:` and `outputs:` entirely** on that task entry — there is no schema to wire against. Any input mapping the sdd.md described becomes a fenced ```` ```text ```` code block under the entry with a `wiring notes (user must attach):` header line. **Do not start lines with `#`** — they would render as markdown headings; use a fenced code block instead. Example shape is in [placeholder-tasks.md § `tasks.md` Planning-Entry Shape](placeholder-tasks.md).
3. Keep every other structural field (display-name, isRequired, runOnlyOnce, order). Task-entry conditions still emit normally.
4. **Continue planning — do not halt.**

At execution time, unresolved tasks become **placeholder tasks** in `caseplan.json` (display-name + type only, no task-type-id, no bindings). The workflow graph is still reviewable end-to-end, and the user attaches real resources + bindings externally before runtime. See [placeholder-tasks.md](placeholder-tasks.md).

## Step 4 — Generate tasks.md and registry-resolved.json

Create a `tasks/` folder adjacent to the sdd.md file. Generate `tasks.md` using the structure below. The **first non-comment line is the schema header** (`Schema: v19` or `Schema: v20` per Step 2.1–2.2). Each subsequent section is a numbered task (`T01`, `T02`, …) — declarative parameters only. Field names use plain identifiers (e.g., `type:`, `displayName:`, `lane:`), not CLI flag syntax. The implementation phase translates each entry into the matching plugin's JSON writes.

Cross-reference: [case-schema.md](case-schema.md) for JSON shape, [bindings-and-expressions.md](bindings-and-expressions.md) for inputs/outputs wiring.

Also write `registry-resolved.json` — full detail per task: search query, all matches, selected entry, rationale.

### 4.0 Completeness principle (no omissions)

Every declaration in `sdd.md` must become a T-task in `tasks.md`. Mapping is 1-to-1:

- **Never filter** declarations on the grounds that the default rule-type, default field value, or "implicit behavior" would cover them. If `sdd.md` lists a task, stage, edge, trigger, condition, SLA row, **variable, or argument**, `tasks.md` emits a T-task for it — regardless of rule-type (`current-stage-entered`, `case-entered`, `exit-only`, `required-tasks-completed`, etc.).
- **Never merge** two sdd.md items into one T-task "because they're similar."
- **Never drop** defaults-looking items (e.g., `is-interrupting: false`, `runOnlyOnce: true`, `marks-stage-complete: true`). The explicit declaration is the signal — honor it.
- **When in doubt, emit.** It is always correct to create a T-task that mirrors an sdd.md row. It is never correct to silently omit one.
- **When format is ambiguous or unrecognized, ASK — do not skip.** If a row exists but you cannot determine the right plugin, category, or T-entry shape (e.g., trigger "Initial Variable Mapping" uses an aggregate phrase instead of explicit per-field mappings; a variable's category — In / Out / Variable — is unclear; a task type does not match the closed enum), invoke **AskUserQuestion** with the row content + the specific ambiguity + bounded options. Silent omission is a defect. This obligation applies to every sdd.md declaration class above, including variables and arguments.

Before presenting `tasks.md` at Step 5, run a completeness cross-check: for every declared stage / edge / task / trigger / condition / SLA row **and every Case Variables table row (one T-entry each, per §4.2.1)** in sdd.md, verify a corresponding T-task exists. Gaps are a defect — fix before approval.

**Cross-check inventory.** Before approval, count and report each class:

| Class | Source in sdd.md | T-entry section |
|---|---|---|
| Case file | Case Metadata | §4.2 (T01) |
| Triggers | Case Triggers | §4.3 (T02+) |
| Variables / arguments | Case Variables | §4.2.1 (after last trigger) |
| Stages | Section 2 stage headings | §4.4 |
| Edges | Stage Entry Conditions / Stage Exit Conditions referencing other stages | §4.5 |
| Tasks | Per-stage Tasks tables | §4.6 |
| Conditions | Stage Entry / Stage Exit / Task Entry / Case Exit tables | §4.7 |
| SLA | Case-Level SLA + per-stage Stage SLA + per-action Task SLA | §4.8 |

Counts that don't match the sdd.md → fix before Step 5 hard stop.

### 4.0a — Section-batched write contract (mandatory)

**Per-section batching.** Build `tasks.md` one section at a time — never compose the full body in memory and Write once, but do not pay a Read between sibling T-entries inside a section either.

Procedure:

1. **Seed.** Write `tasks.md` with header only — `Schema: v19` (or `Schema: v20`), then a `## Inventory` placeholder section. Single Write.
2. **Per section.** Sections are §4.2.1 vars → §4.3 triggers → §4.4 stages → §4.5 edges → §4.6 tasks → §4.7 conditions → §4.8 SLA. For each section:
   - **One Read** of `tasks.md` at section entry.
   - **N Edit-appends** in sequence, one per T-entry in the section. Skip the re-Read between sibling Edits — Edit's tool result confirms applied state in context.
   - TaskUpdate marks each T-entry `in_progress` → `completed` as it goes — that is the per-T-entry audit trail, not the file diff.
3. **Inventory finalize.** After last T-entry, Edit the inventory section with class-by-class counts (per §4.0 cross-check table).
4. **`registry-resolved.json`.** Same section-batched discipline — one Read per section, N Edit-appends, no re-Read between siblings.

Why: section-batched round-trips keep tool-call transcript reviewable, preserve rollback granularity at section boundary, allow mid-run interruption recovery via re-Read + resume from next un-applied T-entry, and surface omissions before they propagate — without paying a per-T-entry Read tax that inflates inference latency by ~5s per turn.

**Hard cap on tasks.md write size.** After the §4.0a Step 1 Seed Write (header + Inventory placeholder, <1KB), the only legal mutation of `tasks.md` is **Edit-append** per the section-batched contract above. A single Write replacing the whole `tasks.md` is **forbidden** regardless of size. A single Edit-append payload >30KB is also forbidden — split into per-section Edit-appends even when consecutive Edits would total >30KB combined. Rationale: a single 96KB Write of tasks.md emits ~40K output tokens in one turn = ~360s inference latency = ~20% of total session in one tool call. Section-batched Edit-appends spread that cost across ~7 turns of ~50s each, recovers reviewability, and matches the recovery contract (re-Read + resume from next un-applied T-entry).

**Recovery on interruption:** re-Read `tasks.md`, scan for next un-applied T-entry (the audit trail in TaskUpdate identifies it), resume from there. No sidecar checkpoint file.

This contract mirrors Phase 3's per-section JSON-write contract (see [implementation.md § Per-plugin execution](implementation.md)).

### 4.1 Task ordering

Always in this order: stages → edges → tasks → conditions → SLA.

The task **title IS the action description** — do not add a redundant `what` or `type` field. Absorb type into the title (e.g., `Add api-workflow task "..."` not `Add task` + `type: api-workflow`).

### 4.2 Create case file (T01)

Title format: `Create case file "<name>"`

Consult [`plugins/case/planning.md`](plugins/case/planning.md) for required fields (name, file path, case-identifier, identifier-type, case-app-enabled, description). Source all fields from sdd.md.

When `identifier-type: external`, `case-identifier` carries the sdd.md expression verbatim (`=vars.<varId>` or `=js:…`); any `=vars.<varId>` it references must be a variable declared in §4.2.1 (an **In** argument or **Variable**). See [`plugins/case/planning.md` § External identifier value](plugins/case/planning.md).

### 4.2.1 Declare global variables and arguments

Title format: `Declare <category> "<name>"` where category is `In argument`, `Out argument`, or `variable`.

One T-entry per variable or argument from the sdd.md "Case Variables" table. Place these after the case file (T01) and **all** trigger T-entries (T02+) — i.e., after the last trigger row, before stages. In multi-trigger cases the variables block starts at `T0<last-trigger>+1`, not at `T03`. Consult [`plugins/variables/global-vars/planning.md`](plugins/variables/global-vars/planning.md) for the SDD-to-category mapping rules and entry format.

### 4.3 Configure trigger(s) (T02+)

Title format: `Configure <trigger-type> trigger "<name>"`

Consult the corresponding trigger plugin (`plugins/triggers/<type>/planning.md`) for required fields.

**One T-entry per trigger row in sdd.md.** A case with N entry-point rows in its triggers table emits N trigger T-entries (T02, T03, …) — even when several rows would resolve to `<UNRESOLVED>` because the IS connection isn't provisioned. Per §4.0, "value can't be resolved yet" is not a reason to omit a row; it's a reason to mark `<UNRESOLVED: …>` and continue. See [edges/planning.md § Multi-Trigger Cases](plugins/edges/planning.md#multi-trigger-cases) for the matching N edges from triggers to the first stage.

Each trigger row uses its plugin's full field set — see `plugins/triggers/<type>/planning.md` for the per-type entry format. Worked example — sdd.md declares 3 entry-point rows (one manual + two events), one of which is unresolved:

```markdown
## T02: Configure manual trigger "Operator Starts Case"
- display-name: "Operator Starts Case"
- description: "Operator kicks off a case from the portal"
- order: after T01
- verify: Confirm node appended; capture TriggerId

## T03: Configure event trigger "New Inbound Email"
- type-id: <uiPathActivityTypeId>
- connection-id: <connection-uuid>
- connector-key: uipath-microsoft-office-365-outlook
- object-name: Email
- event-operation: created
- event-mode: webhooks
- input-values: {"parentFolderId": "AAMkADNm..."}
- filter: "(contains(subject, 'urgent'))"
- order: after T02
- verify: Confirm trigger configured with correct event parameters

## T04: Configure event trigger "Jira Issue Created"
- type-id: <UNRESOLVED: no IS connection for uipath-atlassian-jira>
- connection-id: <UNRESOLVED>
- connector-key: <UNRESOLVED>
- object-name: <UNRESOLVED>
- event-operation: <UNRESOLVED>
- event-mode: <UNRESOLVED>
- order: after T03
- verify: trigger skipped at execution; user attaches after registering connection
```

Do **not** collapse the unresolved trigger into a note on T02 or omit it entirely — execution behavior for unresolved event triggers is documented in [`triggers/event/planning.md § Unresolved Fallback`](plugins/triggers/event/planning.md#unresolved-fallback), but the planning row is still required.

### 4.4 Create stages

Title format: `Create stage "<name>"` or `Create exception stage "<name>"`

One task per stage. Consult [`plugins/stages/planning.md`](plugins/stages/planning.md) for required fields and the `stage` vs `exception` (a.k.a. secondary) decision. Basic properties only — SLA and escalation come later (§4.7).

### 4.5 Setup edges

Title format: `Add edge "<source>" → "<target>"`

One task per edge. Consult [`plugins/edges/planning.md`](plugins/edges/planning.md) for required fields (source, target, label, handles) and the orphan check.

### 4.6 Add tasks

Title format: `Add <type> task "<name>" to "<stage>"`

One task per task from the sdd.md — do NOT group multiple tasks under a single T-number. The plugin for the task's type (`plugins/tasks/<type>/planning.md`) lists exactly which fields to record.

Every task entry includes at least:

- **taskTypeId** — resolved from the registry in Step 3
- **inputs** / **outputs** — see [bindings-and-expressions.md](bindings-and-expressions.md) for the two input modes (literal/expression and cross-task reference)
- **runOnlyOnce** — from sdd.md (default `true` if not specified)
- **isRequired** — from sdd.md (default `true` if not specified)
- **order** — dependency on previous tasks (`after T05`, etc.)
- **lane** — integer, default increments per task within the stage starting at 0 (FE layout). **Exception:** parallel members of a `runs-sequentially` group share the same `lane` (semantic — same lane = parallel siblings inside the sequential group). Solo runs-sequentially tasks still get their own lane.
- **verify** — what the execution phase should check after running

Additional fields are plugin-specific; read the plugin's `planning.md` before filling the entry.

> **No shell commands in task entries.** Each task is a declarative specification. Never write `uip` invocations or any other shell commands inside a task body — the execution phase translates specs into JSON mutations.

> **Record `lane: <n>` per task.** Default: increment within each stage starting at 0 — lane is FE layout only, task ordering comes from task-entry conditions. **Exception:** within a `runs-sequentially` group, tasks meant to run in parallel share the same `lane` (shared lane = parallel siblings inside the sequential group, carries execution semantics). Solo runs-sequentially tasks still get own lane.

> **Placeholder shape for unresolved resources.** If `taskTypeId` / `typeId` / `connectionId` is `<UNRESOLVED: …>`, omit `inputs:` and `outputs:` entirely and capture wiring intent in a trailing comment block. Execution creates a bare task node — structural only. See [placeholder-tasks.md](placeholder-tasks.md) for the full pattern and upgrade path.

### 4.7 Configure conditions

One task per condition. Order within §4.7: stage entry → stage exit → case exit → task entry.

Title format: `Add <scope> condition for "<target>"`

For per-scope fields, consult the corresponding condition plugin:
- `plugins/conditions/stage-entry-conditions/planning.md`
- `plugins/conditions/stage-exit-conditions/planning.md`
- `plugins/conditions/task-entry-conditions/planning.md`
- `plugins/conditions/case-exit-conditions/planning.md`

### 4.8 Set SLA and escalation rules

SLA comes last. Consult [`plugins/sla/planning.md`](plugins/sla/planning.md) for the three sub-operations (default SLA, conditional SLA rules, escalation rules), per-target ordering, and the constraint that conditional SLA rules are root-only.

### 4.9 Not Covered section

Add a brief section at the end of `tasks.md` listing things referenced in sdd.md but outside the scope of `caseplan.json` (e.g., Data Fabric entity schemas). These stay as notes for the user.

---

## Step 5 — HARD STOP: User reviews and approves tasks.md

Present the generated `tasks.md` to the user and ask for explicit approval before proceeding.

Use **AskUserQuestion** with options: `Approve and proceed`, `Request changes`.

If user requests changes, update `tasks.md` and re-present. Do NOT proceed to Phase 2 until user explicitly approves.

**After approval:** re-read `tasks.md` before proceeding to Phase 2 (see [implementation.md](implementation.md)). `tasks.md` is complete handoff artifact — all resolved IDs, inputs, outputs, and references captured there.
