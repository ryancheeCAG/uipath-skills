# stage-entry-conditions — Implementation (Direct JSON Write)

> **Phase split.** Phase 3 only. Phase 2 does not write conditions. See [`../../../phased-execution.md`](../../../phased-execution.md).

Write the stage-entry condition directly to the target stage's `data.entryConditions[]`. No CLI command needed.

## Condition JSON Shape

> **ID format.** Condition `id` is `Condition_` + 6 random chars. Rule `id` is `Rule_` + 6 random chars.

```json
{
  "id": "Condition_xC1XyX",
  "displayName": "After Triage",
  "isInterrupting": false,
  "rules": [
    [
      {
        "id": "Rule_jdBFrJ",
        "rule": "selected-stage-exited",
        "selectedStageId": "Stage_aB3kL9"
      }
    ]
  ]
}
```

Rules use DNF — outer array is OR, inner array is AND.

## Procedure

1. Generate condition ID: `Condition_` + 6 alphanumeric chars
2. Generate rule ID: `Rule_` + 6 alphanumeric chars
3. Locate the target stage in `schema.nodes` by ID
4. Initialize `stageNode.data.entryConditions = []` if absent (regular Stage is created without this key — see [`../../stages/impl-json.md`](../../stages/impl-json.md))
5. Read `rule-type` and `is-interrupting` from tasks.md; pick the recipe below
6. Append the condition object to `stageNode.data.entryConditions[]`

## Rule Types

### case-entered — first-stage entry

```json
"rules": [[ { "id": "Rule_xxxxxx", "rule": "case-entered" } ]]
```

### selected-stage-completed / selected-stage-exited — upstream stage trigger

```json
"rules": [[
  {
    "id": "Rule_xxxxxx",
    "rule": "selected-stage-exited",
    "selectedStageId": "Stage_aB3kL9"
  }
]]
```

Swap `rule` to `selected-stage-completed` when completion semantics are required.

### user-selected-stage — target of a `wait-for-user` exit

```json
"rules": [[ { "id": "Rule_xxxxxx", "rule": "user-selected-stage" } ]]
```

Fires when an upstream stage exits via a `wait-for-user` exit condition and the user picks this stage as the next one. The stage must opt in by declaring this rule — only stages with `user-selected-stage` are presented in the picker.

### wait-for-connector — bind a connector event

A `wait-for-connector` entry rule MUST carry the connector configuration under `rule.uipath`; a bare rule (no `uipath`) is rejected by Studio Web. Build it per [connector-trigger-common.md § Target: connector-bound condition rule](../../../connector-trigger-common.md#target-connector-bound-condition-rule): run the shared `case spec --type trigger` pipeline, write `rule.uipath` with `serviceType: "Intsvc.WaitForEvent"`, mint `elementId = <stageId>-<ruleId>` on inputs/outputs, append root bindings + `bindings_v2` sync.

```json
"rules": [[
  {
    "id": "Rule_xxxxxx",
    "rule": "wait-for-connector",
    "uipath": {
      "serviceType": "Intsvc.WaitForEvent",
      "context": "<caseShape.context — placeholders substituted>",
      "inputs": "<caseShape.inputs — var/id minted, elementId = <stageId>-<ruleId>>",
      "outputs": "<caseShape.outputs — minted, dedup applied>",
      "bindings": []
    },
    "conditionExpression": "=js:event.fraudScore > 0.8"
  }
]]
```

The connector configuration (`uipath`) is required; `conditionExpression` is OPTIONAL — an extra payload gate on the event (bare `=js:<expr>`; wrap sub-clauses in parens when combining: `=js:(vars.X === 'foo') && (vars.Y > 5)`; full rule: [bindings-and-expressions.md § Canonical form per sink](../../../bindings-and-expressions.md#canonical-form-per-sink)). Set `isInterrupting: true` on the condition for exception/fraud/escalation flows.

## Rule-Type Catalog

| `rule` | Required extra field |
|---|---|
| `case-entered` | — |
| `selected-stage-completed` | `selectedStageId` |
| `selected-stage-exited` | `selectedStageId` |
| `user-selected-stage` | — |
| `wait-for-connector` | `uipath` connector configuration (see [common](../../../connector-trigger-common.md#target-connector-bound-condition-rule)) |

`conditionExpression` is optional on every rule — add it to any rule to further gate when it fires.

## Post-Write Verification

Confirm target stage's `data.entryConditions[]` contains the new object with `id`, `isInterrupting` matching the T-entry, and `rules` carrying the expected `rule` value plus any required side field. For `wait-for-connector`: verify `rule.uipath.serviceType` is `"Intsvc.WaitForEvent"`, `rule.uipath.context[]` is populated (placeholders substituted), inputs/outputs `elementId` is `<stageId>-<ruleId>`, and the ConnectionId + FolderKey root bindings exist. CLI `validate` does NOT check `rule.uipath` — confirm via Studio Web.
