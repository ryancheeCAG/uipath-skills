# task-entry-conditions — Implementation (Direct JSON Write)

> **Phase split.** Phase 3 only. Phase 2 does not write conditions. See [`../../../phased-execution.md`](../../../phased-execution.md).

Write the task-entry condition directly to the target task's `entryConditions[]`. No CLI command needed.

## Condition JSON Shape

> **ID format.** Task-level condition `id` is `c` + 8 random chars. Rule `id` is `r` + 8 random chars. These differ from stage/case-level conditions (`Condition_`/`Rule_`).

```json
{
  "id": "c4fGhJ2Mn",
  "displayName": "After Approval",
  "rules": [
    [
      {
        "id": "rK9xQw3Lp",
        "rule": "selected-tasks-completed",
        "selectedTasksIds": ["t8GQTYo8O"]
      }
    ]
  ]
}
```

Rules use DNF — outer array is OR, inner array is AND.

## Procedure

1. Generate condition ID: `c` + 8 alphanumeric chars
2. Generate rule ID: `r` + 8 alphanumeric chars
3. Locate the target stage in `schema.nodes` by ID
4. Locate the target task inside `stageNode.data.tasks[lane][index]` (search every lane until the task ID is found)
5. Initialize `task.entryConditions = []` if absent
6. Read `rule-type` from tasks.md; pick the recipe below
7. Append the condition object to `task.entryConditions[]`

## Rule Types

### current-stage-entered

```json
"rules": [[ { "id": "rxxxxxxxx", "rule": "current-stage-entered" } ]]
```

### selected-tasks-completed — sibling task gating

```json
"rules": [[
  {
    "id": "rxxxxxxxx",
    "rule": "selected-tasks-completed",
    "selectedTasksIds": ["t8GQTYo8O", "tWm4Vx9Tp"]
  }
]]
```

`selectedTasksIds` is a JSON string array.

### adhoc — expression gate

```json
"rules": [[
  {
    "id": "rxxxxxxxx",
    "rule": "adhoc",
    "conditionExpression": "=js:vars.riskScore > 700"
  }
]]
```

`conditionExpression` uses bare `=js:<expr>` (no outer parens) — per FE convention for conditions. Operators (`>`, `<`, `===`, etc.) and function calls go inline. For combined boolean expressions, wrap each sub-clause in parens before joining: `=js:(vars.X === 'foo') && (vars.Y > 5)`. Full per-sink rule: [bindings-and-expressions.md § Canonical form per sink](../../../bindings-and-expressions.md#canonical-form-per-sink).

### wait-for-connector — bind a connector event

Build `rule.uipath` per [connector-trigger-common.md § Target: connector-bound condition rule](../../../connector-trigger-common.md#target-connector-bound-condition-rule) — a bare rule (no `uipath`) is rejected by Studio Web. Task-entry rules are **stage-scoped**: `elementId = <stageId>-<ruleId>`. Run the shared `case spec --type trigger` pipeline, `serviceType: "Intsvc.WaitForEvent"`, append root bindings + `bindings_v2` sync.

```json
"rules": [[
  {
    "id": "rxxxxxxxx",
    "rule": "wait-for-connector",
    "uipath": {
      "serviceType": "Intsvc.WaitForEvent",
      "context": "<caseShape.context — placeholders substituted>",
      "inputs": "<minted, elementId = <stageId>-<ruleId>>",
      "outputs": "<minted, dedup applied>",
      "bindings": []
    },
    "conditionExpression": "=js:event.type === 'order_received'"
  }
]]
```

The connector configuration (`uipath`) is required; `conditionExpression` is optional. CLI `validate` does NOT check `rule.uipath` — confirm via Studio Web.

### runs-sequentially — sequential group with optional parallel siblings

```json
"rules": [[ { "id": "rxxxxxxxx", "rule": "runs-sequentially" } ]]
```

**Lane semantics for this rule type:** Among tasks sharing a `runs-sequentially` task-entry condition, group members meant to run in **parallel** with each other MUST share the same `lane` in `stageNode.data.tasks[lane][index]` (shared lane = parallel siblings inside the sequential group, semantic — not just FE layout). Solo members of the group get their own lane. Tasks outside any `runs-sequentially` group still follow the default one-task-per-lane rule with layout-only semantics.

## Rule-Type Catalog

| `rule` | Required extra field |
|---|---|
| `current-stage-entered` | — |
| `selected-tasks-completed` | `selectedTasksIds` (array) |
| `wait-for-connector` | `uipath` connector configuration (see [common](../../../connector-trigger-common.md#target-connector-bound-condition-rule)) |
| `adhoc` | — |
| `runs-sequentially` | — |

`conditionExpression` is optional on every rule — add it to any rule to further gate when it fires.

## Post-Write Verification

Confirm target task's `entryConditions[]` length equals the number of task-entry T-tasks tasks.md wrote for this task. Each entry carries `id` (prefix `c`) and `rules` with the expected `rule` value plus any required side field. For `wait-for-connector`: verify `rule.uipath.serviceType` is `"Intsvc.WaitForEvent"`, `rule.uipath.context[]` is populated, inputs/outputs `elementId` is `<stageId>-<ruleId>`, and ConnectionId + FolderKey root bindings exist. CLI `validate` does NOT check `rule.uipath` — confirm via Studio Web.
