# bindings_v2.json Sync

Shared procedure for keeping `bindings_v2.json` in sync after any plugin writes to the bindings array in `caseplan.json`.

## Schema-dependent source path

Read `Schema:` header from `tasks.md` per Rule 18.

| Schema | Source path in `caseplan.json` |
|---|---|
| **v19** | `root.data.uipath.bindings[]` |
| **v20** | `bindings[]` *(top level)* |

Field shape inside the array is identical across schemas — only the source path for the regeneration read differs. Output `bindings_v2.json` shape is unchanged across schemas.

## When to Run

**Batched, not per-task.** `bindings_v2.json` is only consumed by `uip solution resource refresh` (which runs once before upload/debug). No intermediate step reads it. Regenerating after every task wastes Read→convert→Write cycles on a growing file.

Run at these three points only:

1. **End of Phase 2 Step 9** (after all non-connector tasks written) — covers all process/agent/rpa/action/api-workflow/case-management bindings
2. **End of Phase 3 Step 9.7** (after all connector tasks populated) — adds Connection bindings + populates IS cache for tasks
3. **End of Phase 3 Step 10** (after all connector condition RULES written across the 4 scopes — stage-entry, stage-exit, case-exit, task-entry) — adds Connection bindings + populates IS cache for rules. Required because connector rules are written in Step 10 (conditions), not Step 9.7 (tasks); without this third sync point, rule-introduced Connection/Folder bindings + IS-cache entries wouldn't land until the post-Phase-3 catch-all, and `resource refresh` would miss them.

Individual task / rule plugins write bindings to `caseplan.json` per-target as normal (path per § Schema-dependent source path above). The batch regeneration reads the full bindings array once from the schema-appropriate path and converts everything in one pass.

## § Regenerate bindings_v2.json

After writing bindings (to the schema-appropriate path), regenerate `bindings_v2.json`. This file uses a **different format**: `caseplan.json` stores two entries per resource (one per property), `bindings_v2.json` stores one entry per resource with properties nested under `value`.

### Procedure

1. Read the bindings array from `caseplan.json` — `root.data.uipath.bindings[]` in v19, top-level `bindings[]` in v20
2. Group bindings by `resourceKey` — entries sharing the same key belong to one resource
3. For each group, produce one resource entry using the shapes below
4. Write the full file (always overwrite, never append) to `<SolutionDir>/<ProjectName>/bindings_v2.json`

### Non-connector resource entry

```json
{
  "resource": "<resource>",
  "key": "<resourceKey>",
  "value": {
    "name": { "defaultValue": "<name binding default>" },
    "folderPath": { "defaultValue": "<folderPath binding default>" }
  },
  "metadata": { "subType": "<resourceSubType — omit metadata key if none>" }
}
```

### Connector resource entry

```json
{
  "resource": "Connection",
  "key": "<connectionId>",
  "value": {
    "connectionId": { "defaultValue": "<connectionId>" },
    "folderKey": { "defaultValue": "<folderKey>" }
  },
  "metadata": { "connector": "<connectorKey>" }
}
```

> **Known CLI bug:** `syncConnectionResources` reads `value.connectionId` (lowercase c) but `flow-schema` writes `value.ConnectionId` (uppercase C). Use **lowercase `connectionId`** until fixed.

File envelope: `{ "version": "2.0", "resources": [ /* one entry per resource */ ] }`

---

## § Populate IS connection cache

`uip solution resource refresh` reads a local IS cache that connector plugins must populate after `get-connection`. Applies to all three connector-resolving paths: connector **tasks** (Step 9.7), connector **triggers** (Step 8), and connector **condition rules** in any of the 4 scopes (Step 10).

**Path:** `~/.uipath/cache/integrationservice/<connectorKey>/connections.json`

**Shape — bare JSON array:**

```json
[
    {
        "id": "<connectionId>",
        "name": "<connectionName>",
        "connectorKey": "<connectorKey>",
        "connectorName": "<connectorName>",
        "folderKey": "<folderKey>",
        "folderName": "<folderName>"
    }
]
```

### Field sources

| Field | Source | Plugin step |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | `connection-id` from `tasks.md` | Planning |
| `name` | `.Data.Connections[selected].name` from `get-connection` | Step 1 |
| `connectorKey` | `connector-key` from `tasks.md` | Planning |
| `connectorName` | `.Data.Connections[selected].connector.name` from `get-connection` | Step 1 |
| `folderKey` | `.Data.Connections[selected].folder.key` from `get-connection` | Step 1 |
| `folderName` | `.Data.Connections[selected].folder.name` from `get-connection` | Step 1 |

### Procedure

After `get-connection` succeeds (Step 1), write or merge the cache:

1. Read existing cache at the path above (may not exist — start with `[]`)
2. If an entry with the same `id` already exists, skip
3. Otherwise append the new entry
4. Write the file as a bare JSON array (NOT wrapped in `{ cachedAt, data }`)

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.uipath/cache/integrationservice/<connectorKey>
```

> Workaround for CLI bugs: (1) tenant-ID prefix in cache path, (2) wrapped `{ cachedAt, data }` format. Direct write bypasses both.

## What `resource refresh` produces

With `bindings_v2.json` and IS cache in place, `uip solution resource refresh` creates:

| Input | Output | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Non-connector bindings in `bindings_v2.json` | `resources/solution_folder/process/` files | Resource declarations imported from Orchestrator |
| Connection binding in `bindings_v2.json` + IS cache | `resources/solution_folder/connection/<connectorKey>/<name>.json` | Connection resource declaration |
| Both | `userProfile/<userId>/debug_overwrites.json` | Maps abstract resources to Orchestrator instances for debug |

All three required for `uip solution upload` and `uip maestro case debug` to work without "Resource is not configured" warnings.

---

## Cleanup on task or rule removal

When any task or connector condition rule is removed and its root bindings are pruned (per [case-editing-operations.md](case-editing-operations.md) § Delete a node / § Delete a connector condition rule):

1. After pruning root bindings, regenerate `bindings_v2.json` from the updated array.
