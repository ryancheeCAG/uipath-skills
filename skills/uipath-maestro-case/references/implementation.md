# Phases 2–6 — Execution: tasks.md → caseplan.json

Execute approved `tasks.md` plan, building `caseplan.json` via direct JSON edits per plugin. Validate, then optionally debug and publish. Five phases: **Phase 2 Prototyping** → **Phase 3 Implementation** → **Phase 4 Validate** → **Phase 5 Debug** → **Phase 6 Publish**.

> **Prerequisite:** User must have explicitly approved `tasks.md` from [Phase 1 Planning](planning.md) before starting.
>
> **Input:** `tasks/tasks.md` — the complete handoff artifact.

> **Five phases follow planning.** Execution splits into **Phase 2 — Prototyping** (skeleton build), **Phase 3 — Implementation** (detail build), **Phase 4 — Validate** (authoritative validate + dump), **Phase 5 — Debug** (optional CLI debug run), **Phase 6 — Publish** (optional Studio Web upload). Hard stops gate Phase 2→3, Phase 4 retry exhaustion, Phase 5 entry, and Phase 6 entry. Read [phased-execution.md](phased-execution.md) for full phase contracts, informational Phase 2 validate, hard-stop prompts, re-entry protocol, retry policy, and abort semantics. Step numbering below marks phase boundaries.

## Per-plugin execution

Every plugin uses direct JSON writes via its `impl-json.md`. Cross-cutting mechanics (ID generation, Pre-flight Checklist, primitive ops) are in [case-editing-operations.md](case-editing-operations.md).

**Incremental write per T-entry — mandatory, no exceptions.** Process `tasks.md` one T-entry at a time:

1. Read `caseplan.json` (recover authoritative state).
2. Apply that single T-entry's mutation via Edit (or Write for first scaffold only).
3. Re-Read `caseplan.json` before the next T-entry.

**Exception — batch within class.** When the next ≥2 consecutive T-entries are all the same class (all stages, all edges, all global variables, all task-shape-only writes in Phase 2, or all conditions of the same scope) AND target disjoint JSON sub-trees (different `nodes[]` slots, different keys), batch them into ONE Edit call. The class-internal ordering inside the batch must still follow `tasks.md` order. After the batch, Re-Read before moving to the next class.

Do NOT:

- Accumulate multiple stages/edges/tasks/conditions in memory and flush a single monolithic JSON.
- Compose the full `caseplan.json` in one Write.
- Skip the re-Read between classes — context can compact across long batches.

Per-T-entry round-trips keep the tool-call transcript reviewable, preserve rollback granularity, allow mid-run interruption, and prevent silent cross-entry interference. Mirrors the Phase 1 incremental contract in [planning.md § 4.0a](planning.md). See [SKILL.md § Anti-patterns](../SKILL.md) and [case-editing-operations.md § Read → modify → write](case-editing-operations.md#read--modify--write).

> **Per-node-type detail lives in plugins.** This document covers the cross-cutting execution workflow. For how to execute a specific node, consult the matching plugin's `impl-json.md`:

## Issue Log — Initialize Before Step 6

Before any build step, initialize an empty issue list **in the agent's reasoning** (not as a file, not via subprocess). All plugins append to this shared list during execution. Dump to `tasks/build-issues.md` via the Write tool after Step 12. See [`plugins/logging/impl-json.md`](plugins/logging/impl-json.md) for the entry format, severity levels, and file schema.

```text
# pseudocode — kept in the agent's reasoning, not on disk
issues = []  # shared across all steps
```

---

## Seed Phase 2 progress todos — Before Step 6

Before Step 6, seed TodoWrite with the items below to track Phase 2 progress through scaffold + structural emit + skeleton validate. Mark each `in_progress` on entry, `completed` on exit. Replace any Phase 1 todos — do not append.

1. Scaffold solution + project + root case (Step 6)
2. Add triggers (Step 6.1)
3. Declare variables + arguments (Step 6.2)
4. Add stages (Step 7)
5. Connect edges (Step 8)
6. Write task shapes (Step 9)
7. Regenerate bindings_v2.json (Step 9.4)
8. Skeleton validate + hard stop (Step 9.5)

---

# Phase 2 — Prototyping (Steps 6 – 9.5)

Steps 6 through 9.5 build structural skeleton: solution, project, root case, global variables, stages, edges, triggers, and tasks without value binding. Full contract in [phased-execution.md § Phase 2](phased-execution.md#phase-2--prototyping).

## Step 6 — Create the Case project structure

The case file must live inside a solution + project. The case plugin owns project scaffolding **and** the root caseplan write. Solution setup and project registration are the only CLI calls:

1. **Step 6.0 (CLI)** — `uip solution init <SolutionName>` — creates the solution directory + `.uipx`.
2. **T01 (plugin)** — execute [`plugins/case/impl-json.md`](plugins/case/impl-json.md) in full:
   - § Scaffold writes 5 boilerplate files (`project.uiproj`, `operate.json`, `entry-points.json`, `bindings_v2.json`, `package-descriptor.json`) directly into `<SolutionDir>/<ProjectName>/`.
   - § Write caseplan.json writes the root skeleton (`root` + empty `nodes: []` + empty `edges: []`).
3. **Step 6.0b (CLI)** — `uip solution project add <AbsolutePathToProjectDir> <AbsolutePathToUipxFile> --output json` — registers the project in `.uipx.Projects[]`. **Both arguments MUST be absolute paths.** Relative form `uip solution project add <ProjectName> <SolutionName>.uipx` fails with `Failed to add project to solution` regardless of CWD. Runs after `project.uiproj` exists.

**No trigger is emitted at T01.** The primary trigger is added by the triggers plugin at T02 — its ID is generated by that plugin. `entry-points.json` is scaffolded with an empty `entryPoints[]` array — the triggers plugin owns every insertion.

## Step 6.1 — Add triggers

For each trigger T-entry in `tasks.md §4.3`, open the matching plugin's `impl-json.md`:

- Manual / Timer / Event (resolved) → `plugins/triggers/<type>/impl-json.md` §3
- Event (UNRESOLVED) → [`plugins/triggers/event/impl-json.md` § Placeholder fallback](plugins/triggers/event/impl-json.md) — node still written; case stays reachable

Each plugin writes one node to `caseplan.json.nodes[]` and appends one entry to `entry-points.json.entryPoints[]` atomically. Capture every `TriggerId` for Step 6.2 (In-arg `elementId`) and Step 8 (edges).

## Step 6.2 — Declare global variables and arguments

For each variable/argument T-entry from `tasks.md §4.2.1`, write entries directly into `caseplan.json` per [`plugins/variables/global-vars/impl-json.md`](plugins/variables/global-vars/impl-json.md). This step populates `root.data.uipath.variables` (inputs, outputs, inputOutputs) and trigger output mappings. Execute these before adding stages — downstream tasks and conditions reference variables via `=vars.<id>`.

## Step 7 — Add stages

For each stage in `tasks.md §4.4`, execute per [`plugins/stages/impl-json.md`](plugins/stages/impl-json.md). **Capture the generated `StageId` for every stage** into the name → ID map (and into `id-map.json`) — downstream edges, tasks, conditions, and SLA all reference it.

`isRequired` from `tasks.md` is planning-only metadata; it is not written into the stage node. It is consumed later by case-exit-conditions with `rule-type: required-stages-completed` (Step 10).

## Step 8 — Connect stages with edges

For each edge in `tasks.md §4.5`, execute per [`plugins/edges/impl-json.md`](plugins/edges/impl-json.md). Edge type is inferred automatically from the source node's `type` in `schema.nodes`.

For multi-trigger cases, add the additional triggers first via the appropriate trigger plugin, then wire their IDs as edge sources.

## Step 9 — Add tasks (Phase 2 shape)

For each task entry in `tasks.md §4.6`, open matching plugin's `impl-json.md`. **Capture the `TaskId`** — cross-task references and conditions in Phase 3 need it.

**Phase 2 writes task shape but defers value binding to Phase 3.** Per-class shape:

| Task class | Phase 2 `data` content |
|---|---|
| Non-connector (`process`, `agent`, `rpa`, `action`, `api-workflow`, `case-management`, `wait-for-timer`) | Full `data.inputs[]` schema from `uip maestro case tasks describe --type <type> --id <entityKey>`. Each input's `value` is `""`. Outputs populated per plugin. |
| Connector (`connector-activity`, `connector-trigger`) | `data.typeId` + `data.connectionId` set. `data.inputs` omitted. **Do NOT call `case spec` in Phase 2** — schema discovery happens in Phase 3. |
| Unresolved (any class) | Placeholder task per Step 9.1 — empty `data: {}` plus action-only extras. |

**Do NOT bind input `value` fields in Step 9.** All literals, expressions, and cross-task references written in Phase 3 Step 9.8 per [`plugins/variables/io-binding/impl-json.md`](plugins/variables/io-binding/impl-json.md).

**Pass `lane: <n>` on every task** (or the plugin's equivalent JSON field). Default: increment per task within a stage starting at 0 — lane is FE-layout-only for these tasks. **Exception:** parallel members of a `runs-sequentially` group share the same `lane` (shared lane = parallel siblings inside the sequential group, carries execution semantics). Solo runs-sequentially tasks still get own lane.

### Step 9.1 — Placeholder tasks for unresolved resources

When a task entry's `taskTypeId` (or `typeId` / `connectionId` for connector tasks) is `<UNRESOLVED: …>`, create a **placeholder task** instead of halting. See [placeholder-tasks.md](placeholder-tasks.md) for the canonical reference.

For every task class (process / agent / rpa / action / api-workflow / case-management / connector-activity / connector-trigger): follow the Unresolved Fallback section of the matching `plugins/tasks/<type>/planning.md` and write a task with `type` + `displayName` + `id` + `elementId` + `isRequired`, `data: {}`, and no `taskTypeId` / `connectionId` keys directly to `caseplan.json` per `plugins/tasks/<type>/impl-json.md`.

**Skip all input binding for placeholder tasks** — they have no input schema. Capture the intended wiring from the fenced `wiring notes` code block in `tasks.md` into the completion report so the user knows what to hook up after registering the resource.

Placeholder tasks integrate with the rest of the graph:
- **Task-entry conditions** use the captured placeholder `TaskId` normally.
- **Stage-exit `selected-tasks-completed`** rules reference placeholder `TaskId`s normally.
- **Cross-task variable bindings** are deferred — the user binds them after attaching the real resource.

## Step 9.4 — Regenerate bindings_v2.json (batch)

After all non-connector tasks are written (Step 9), regenerate `bindings_v2.json` once per [bindings-v2-sync.md § Regenerate](bindings-v2-sync.md). This single pass converts all root bindings accumulated during Step 9 — no per-task regeneration needed.

## Step 9.5 — Placeholder-mode validate + HARD STOP

End of Phase 2. Full contract (summary content, prompt options, publish branch, abort cleanup, continue branch) in [phased-execution.md § Phase 2 hard stop](phased-execution.md#phase-2-hard-stop). This section is a bridge — do NOT duplicate contract here.

1. Run placeholder-profile validate:

   ```bash
   uip maestro case validate "<caseplan.json path>" --skeleton --output json
   ```

   `--skeleton` skips tasks, SLAs, escalations, and entry/exit rules — those are filled in Phase 3. Structural checks (nodes, edges, identity, types, topology) still run.

   **Do NOT halt on errors or warnings.** Capture error + warning counts for summary; remaining errors are structural and surfaced to user via the hard-stop prompt.

2. Print hard-stop summary, including captured validate counts ([phased-execution.md § Summary content](phased-execution.md#summary-content)).

3. Execute hard-stop prompt + branches per [phased-execution.md § Prompt](phased-execution.md#prompt) and following sections. Unconditional — SKILL.md Rule 11.

On continue (either `Skip publish and continue` or `Continue to phase 3` after publish): proceed to Step 9.6.

---

# Phase 3 — Implementation (Steps 9.6 – 11)

Steps 9.6 onwards wire connector task schemas, input/output values, conditions, and SLA. Full contract in [phased-execution.md § Phase 3](phased-execution.md#phase-3--implementation).

## Step 9.6 — Phase 3 re-entry

Before any Phase 3 mutation:

1. **Re-read `tasks.md`** — per Rule 7 of `SKILL.md`. Recover schema choice from the `Schema:` header (first non-comment line); per Rule 18 it is the source of truth for whether downstream writes target v19 or v20 paths.
2. **Re-read `caseplan.json`** — rebuild name → ID maps from authoritative artifact. See [phased-execution.md § Re-entry protocol](phased-execution.md#re-entry-protocol) for which fields to index. **Verify schema consistency**: caseplan.json's `version` literal (`"v19"` at `root.version` for v19, `"20.0.0"` at top level for v20) MUST match the tasks.md `Schema:` header. On mismatch, halt with explicit error — never silently re-flip (Rule 18).
3. **Seed Phase 3 progress todos** — call TodoWrite with the items below. Mark each `in_progress` on entry, `completed` on exit. Surfaces progress through long-running connector schema loops and binding passes. Phase 2 todos (if any) are stale — replace, do not append.
   1. Wire connector task schemas (Step 9.7)
   2. Bind task I/O values (Step 9.8)
   3. Add conditions (Step 10)
   4. Configure SLA + escalation (Step 11)

Never trust in-memory maps from Phase 2 without re-reading `caseplan.json` — context may be compacted across hard stop.

## Step 9.7 — Connector task detail

For each connector task (`connector-activity`, `connector-trigger`) in `tasks.md`:

1. Run `get-connection` (each task runs its own — never reuse), then `uip maestro case spec --type <activity|trigger> --activity-type-id <id> --connection-id <id> --input-details '<json>'` per the plugin's `impl-json.md`.
2. Substitute `{{CONN_BINDING_ID}}` / `{{FOLDER_BINDING_ID}}` placeholders in `caseShape.context[*].value` with minted binding ids; mint `var` / `id` / `elementId` on `caseShape.inputs` / `outputs` per the plugin's uniqueness rule.
3. Write `data.context = caseShape.context`, `data.inputs = caseShape.inputs`, `data.outputs = caseShape.outputs` plus the root-level Connection + FolderKey bindings into the existing task in `caseplan.json`.
4. Populate IS connection cache per [bindings-v2-sync.md § Populate IS connection cache](bindings-v2-sync.md).

Skip connector tasks that are placeholders (unresolved `typeId` / `connectionId`) — they stay bare.

After all connector tasks are done, **regenerate `bindings_v2.json`** once per [bindings-v2-sync.md § Regenerate](bindings-v2-sync.md). This single pass includes both the non-connector bindings from Step 9 and the Connection bindings from this step.

## Step 9.8 — Bind task input/output values

For each task's inputs in `tasks.md` order, write values into the existing `data.inputs[i].value` fields per [`plugins/variables/io-binding/impl-json.md`](plugins/variables/io-binding/impl-json.md):

1. Literals / expressions (`input = "<value>"`): write `<value>` to `input.value`.
2. Cross-task references (`input <- "Stage"."Task".output`): resolve source output's `var` field from `caseplan.json`, then write `=vars.<var>` to the target input's `value`.

If a cross-task reference points to a task that does not exist in `caseplan.json`, halt — `tasks.md` ordering is wrong; report to the user.

Skip placeholder tasks entirely — they have no inputs.

## Step 10 — Add conditions

For each condition in `tasks.md §4.7`, open the matching plugin's `impl-json.md`:

- Stage entry → [`plugins/conditions/stage-entry-conditions/impl-json.md`](plugins/conditions/stage-entry-conditions/impl-json.md)
- Stage exit → [`plugins/conditions/stage-exit-conditions/impl-json.md`](plugins/conditions/stage-exit-conditions/impl-json.md)
- Task entry → [`plugins/conditions/task-entry-conditions/impl-json.md`](plugins/conditions/task-entry-conditions/impl-json.md)
- Case exit → [`plugins/conditions/case-exit-conditions/impl-json.md`](plugins/conditions/case-exit-conditions/impl-json.md)

## Step 11 — SLA and escalation

Group `tasks.md §4.8` entries by target (root or stage), then compose and write full `slaRules[]` array per target in single mutation per [`plugins/sla/impl-json.md`](plugins/sla/impl-json.md). Supports per-conditional-rule escalations, ExceptionStage SLA, and multi-recipient single rules.

End of Phase 3 mutations. Proceed directly to Phase 4 — no hard stop between Phase 3 and Phase 4.

---

# Phase 4 — Validate (Steps 12 – 12.1)

Authoritative validation. Full contract — command, retry policy, AskUserQuestion options — in [phased-execution.md § Phase 4](phased-execution.md#phase-4--validate). This section is a bridge — do NOT duplicate contract here.

## Step 12 — Full validate

Run validate per [phased-execution.md § Phase 4](phased-execution.md#phase-4--validate). On success: proceed to Step 12.1. On 3rd failure: hard-stop prompt per the same section.

## Step 12.1 — Dump issue log

Write issue list to `tasks/build-issues.md` per [`plugins/logging/impl-json.md`](plugins/logging/impl-json.md). On Phase 4 success → proceed to Phase 5.

---

# Phase 5 — Debug (Steps 13, 13a)

Optional CLI debug run. Full contract — report fields, prompt options, debug command, safety warning, loop behavior — in [phased-execution.md § Phase 5](phased-execution.md#phase-5--debug). This section is a bridge — do NOT duplicate contract here.

## Step 13 — Completion report + Debug prompt + session

Print report fields and run AskUserQuestion + debug command per [phased-execution.md § Phase 5](phased-execution.md#phase-5--debug). On `Run debug session` → run `uip solution resource refresh` then `uip maestro case debug`, loop until `Skip to Publish`. On `Skip to Publish` → Phase 6. Never auto-run (Rule 12).

## Step 13a — Troubleshoot failed case

When a debug or process run fails, read **[troubleshooting-guide.md](troubleshooting-guide.md)**. Diagnostic priority: incidents → runtime variables → caseplan.json correlation → traces (last resort).

**Diagnose → fix → re-run loop.** After each diagnostic pass, classify root cause and act:

1. **Fixable in `caseplan.json`** (wrong binding, missing condition, malformed expression, incorrect input value): apply targeted fix via matching plugin's `impl-json.md`, re-run `uip maestro case validate`, then re-run Step 13 debug.
2. **Fixable outside `caseplan.json`** (missing/expired connection, unregistered task type, missing Orchestrator asset, permissions): halt agent edits. Report exact resource + remediation steps to user via **AskUserQuestion** with options — `Resource fixed, re-run debug`, `Abort`.
3. **Inconclusive** (no actionable cause): proceed to next round per retry policy.

**Retry policy.** Up to 3 troubleshoot → fix → debug rounds per failed run. Each round must add new context (different element ID, broader scope, fallback command) or apply different fix — do not repeat identical commands or re-apply same fix. Track round count.

**Per-round timeout.** If debug run exceeds 10 minutes wall-clock, treat round as inconclusive and advance to next round (counts toward 3-round limit). Advisory — do not hard-kill subprocess; classify by elapsed time and move on.

After 3rd inconclusive round (or 3rd debug failure post-fix), halt and ask user with **AskUserQuestion**. Report: instance ID, folder key, incident IDs/messages, faulting element ID, variable snapshot, what was tried each round. Options — `Provide additional context` (user supplies hints; run one more targeted round), `Pause for manual investigation`, `Abort`. Do not propose `caseplan.json` edits without confirmed cause.

---

# Phase 6 — Publish (Steps 14, 15)

Optional Studio Web upload. Full contract — prompt options, publish commands, pack/publish warning — in [phased-execution.md § Phase 6](phased-execution.md#phase-6--publish). This section is a bridge — do NOT duplicate contract here.

## Step 14 — Publish prompt

Run AskUserQuestion per [phased-execution.md § Phase 6](phased-execution.md#phase-6--publish). On `Publish to Studio Web` → Step 15. On `Done` → exit skill.

## Step 15 — Publish to Studio Web

Run `uip solution resource refresh` then `uip solution upload` per [phased-execution.md § Publish notes](phased-execution.md#publish-notes). Print `DesignerUrl`. Exit skill.
