# UiPath Agents

## Hard Rules

- Treat "build/create/scaffold/implement a UiPath agent" as the full One-Prompt Flow by default. Do not stop after file creation or local run unless the user explicitly says to stop there.
- A normal completion point is after smoke eval and the mandatory Delivery fork question. A final build summary before that is premature unless run/eval is blocked or the user opted out.

## Project Type Detection

Determine the agent mode before proceeding:

1. **Check for existing project files** in the working directory:
   - `pyproject.toml` with `uipath` dependency + `.py` files → **Coded**
   - `agent.json` with `"type": "lowCode"` + `project.uiproj`, AND no `pyproject.toml` → **Low-code**
2. **No existing project found** → ask the user:
   > Should I build this as a **low-code agent** (no Python — configure through prompts and pre-built UiPath tools) or a **coded agent** (Python — full programmatic control with LangGraph, LlamaIndex, or OpenAI Agents)?
3. If the user needs help deciding, read [references/coded-vs-lowcode-guide.md](references/coded-vs-lowcode-guide.md) for a capability comparison.

**After detection, read the quickstart for that mode before doing anything else:**

- **Coded** → read [references/coded/quickstart.md](references/coded/quickstart.md). Quickstart's first step detects project state (`greenfield` / `existing-coded` / `local-workspace`) and gates each lifecycle step on it. For Studio Web Local Workspace specifics, see [references/coded/lifecycle/local-workspace.md](references/coded/lifecycle/local-workspace.md).
- **Low-code** → read [references/lowcode/lowcode.md](references/lowcode/lowcode.md)
