# UiPath RPA Assistant

Full assistant for creating, editing, managing, and running UiPath automation projects — both coded workflows (C#) and low-code RPA workflows (XAML).

## When to Use This Skill

- User wants to **create a new** UiPath automation project (coded or XAML)
- User wants to **add** a workflow, test case, or source file to an existing project
- User wants to **edit** an existing workflow or test case
- User wants to **modify project configuration** (dependencies, entry points)
- User asks about **UiPath activities** or how to automate something
- User wants to **validate, build, run, or debug** a workflow
- User wants to **add dependencies** or NuGet packages to a project
- User wants to **create test cases** with assertions
- User wants to **call an Integration Service connector** (Jira, Salesforce, ServiceNow, Slack, etc.)
- User wants to **use UI automation** to interact with desktop or web applications

## Precondition: Project Context

Before doing any work, check if `.claude/rules/project-context.md` exists in the project directory.

**If the file exists** → check for staleness:
1. Read the first line of `.claude/rules/project-context.md` to extract the metadata comment: `<!-- discovery-metadata: cs=N xaml=N deps=N -->`
2. Count current files: Glob `**/*.cs` (excluding `.local/` and `.codedworkflows/`) and `**/*.xaml` in the project directory
3. Count current dependencies: read `project.json` and count keys in the `.dependencies` object
4. Compare the current counts against the stored metadata values
5. For each count (cs, xaml, deps), compute the percentage difference: `abs(current - stored) / max(stored, 1) * 100`
6. If **any individual count differs by 60–70% or more** → run the discovery flow below
7. If all counts are within the threshold → context is fresh, proceed with the skill workflow

**If the file does NOT exist** → run the discovery flow below.

**Discovery flow** (used for both missing and stale context):
1. Trigger the `uipath-project-discovery-agent` and wait for it to complete
2. The agent returns the generated context document as its response
3. Write the returned content to **both**:
   - `.claude/rules/project-context.md` (create `.claude/rules/` directory if needed) — auto-loaded by Claude Code in future sessions
   - `AGENTS.md` at project root — read by UiPath Autopilot in Studio Desktop. If `AGENTS.md` already exists, look for `<!-- PROJECT-CONTEXT:START -->` / `<!-- PROJECT-CONTEXT:END -->` markers and replace only between them; if no markers exist, append the fenced block at the end
4. Then proceed with the skill workflow

## Step 0: Resolve PROJECT_DIR

Before creating or modifying anything, determine which project to work with. See [references/environment-setup.md](references/environment-setup.md) for the full procedure.

**Quick check:** Find `project.json` to establish `{projectRoot}`. That's it — no Studio Desktop check needed. `uip rpa` auto-launches a headless Studio (UiPath.Studio.Helm NuGet) on first call. Studio Desktop is required only for `files diff` and `focus-activity`.

## Project Type Detection

After establishing `PROJECT_DIR`, determine whether this is a **coded** or **XAML** project:

1. **Coded mode** — `.cs` files with `[Workflow]` or `[TestCase]` attributes exist AND no `.xaml` workflow files (beyond scaffolded `Main.xaml`)
2. **XAML mode** — `.xaml` workflow files exist AND no coded workflow `.cs` files
3. **Hybrid** — Both exist → consult [coded-vs-xaml-guide.md](references/coded-vs-xaml-guide.md) to pick the right mode for each new file; default to matching the user's current request
4. **New project** — Neither exists → **default to XAML.** Switch to coded only when the user explicitly says "coded", ".cs", "C# workflow", "coded test case", or names a coded-specific trigger (custom data models / DTOs, unit-testable business logic). For all other phrasings ("create a workflow", "automate X", "build an automation"), use XAML. See [coded-vs-xaml-guide.md](references/coded-vs-xaml-guide.md) for the full decision flowchart.

**Routing:** Once mode is determined, use the Task Navigation table below to find the right reference files. For guidance on **choosing** between coded and XAML approaches, see [coded-vs-xaml-guide.md](references/coded-vs-xaml-guide.md).

## Authoring Mode Selection

**Default to matching the project's existing mode.** For new projects or ambiguous cases, **default to XAML** — it is the more common mode, has the widest activity coverage, and is the unmarked term in user vocabulary ("create a workflow" means XAML; "create a coded workflow" means coded). Switch to coded only on explicit user phrasing or a coded-specific trigger from the table below.

| Scenario | Mode | Why |
|----------|------|-----|
| Standard RPA (Excel, email, file ops) | **XAML** (default) | Direct activity support, no code needed |
| UI automation | **XAML** (default) | Full activity support; coded also works via `uiAutomation` service |
| Integration Service connectors (XAML) | **XAML** | IS connector activities use XAML-specific dynamic activity config |
| No matching activity for a subtask | **Coded fallback** | Small .cs invoked from XAML via `Invoke Workflow File` |
| Complex data transforms, HTTP, parsing | **Coded** | C# is more natural than nested XAML activities |
| Tempted to call a PowerShell script | **Coded** | Prefer a coded workflow. If PS is genuinely needed (admin cmdlets, existing `.ps1`), use the `InvokePowerShell<T>` activity — never `Invoke Process` + `powershell.exe`. See [powershell-interop-guide.md](references/powershell-interop-guide.md) |
| Custom data models / DTOs | **Coded Source File** | XAML cannot define types — plain `.cs`, no `CodedWorkflow` base |
| Unit tests with assertions | **Coded Test Case** | `[TestCase]` with Arrange/Act/Assert |
| User explicitly requests coded/XAML | **User's choice** | Never second-guess explicit preference |

### UI Automation Boundaries

For any task whose business behavior is "open an app/browser, click, type, scrape visible UI, submit a form, or verify UI state", the interaction layer MUST be UiPath UI Automation — `NApplicationCard` plus UIA activities (XAML), or `uiAutomation.Open`/`Attach` plus Object Repository descriptors (coded). Do NOT substitute `InvokeCode`, PowerShell, Selenium, Playwright, Chrome DevTools Protocol, raw DOM JavaScript, HTTP form posts, or external browser-driver scripts. The coded fallback rows above apply only to non-UI helper logic (data transforms, parsing, DTOs, calculations, API-only integrations).

If target configuration is unavailable, fall back to the documented UIA indication path — never to an external browser automation shortcut.

See [ui-automation-guide.md § Mandatory: Generate Targets Before Writing Any UI Code](references/ui-automation-guide.md#mandatory-generate-targets-before-writing-any-ui-code) for the full prohibited-tool list, the UIA-only exploration requirement, and the `InvokeJS`/`InjectJsScript` exception scope.

**Hybrid pattern** — XAML orchestration + coded fallback for logic with no matching activity:

    Main.xaml                  ← orchestration (XAML)
      └── InvokeWorkflowFile → ProcessData.cs  ← coded logic

For the full decision flowchart, InvokeCode extraction rules, and detailed hybrid patterns, see [coded-vs-xaml-guide.md](references/coded-vs-xaml-guide.md).

## Capture-First Fast Path

When the request is "automate this dialog/form" or "build a UI test from these manual steps" — i.e. the bulk of the work is target capture, not coding — **defer authoring-phase prerequisites until target capture is complete**. The capture surface is interactive, app-state-sensitive, and time-bound; project-context discovery and analyzer rules add nothing during capture and steal time from it.

**Fast-path order for capture-first tasks:**

1. **Pre-flight Window Baseline** — list top-level windows once; decide whether to launch the app. See [ui-automation-guide.md § Pre-flight: Window Baseline](references/ui-automation-guide.md#pre-flight-window-baseline).
2. **Inventory targets from manual steps** (Test Manager test case, PDD, or written script). Each "Click X" / "Enter Y" / "Select Z" / "Verify W" step maps to one OR element. Group by screen state. See [ui-automation-guide.md § Capturing from Manual Test Steps](references/ui-automation-guide.md#capturing-from-manual-test-steps).
3. **Capture all targets** screen by screen via `uia-configure-target` and screen advancement. See [uia-configure-target-workflows.md § Multi-Step UI Flows](references/uia-configure-target-workflows.md#multi-step-ui-flows).
4. **Then enter authoring phase:** project-context discovery (the precondition above), analyzer rules (Critical Rule 3 — Authoring-phase start), write code, validate.

Skip this path when the task has no UI surface (data transforms, IS connector calls, headless file/email automation).

## Critical Rules

### Common Rules (Both Modes)

1. **NEVER create a project without confirming none exists.** Follow Step 0 resolution: check explicit path, project name, then CWD for `project.json`. Only create when confirmed no project matches AND user explicitly requests creation.
2. **ALWAYS use `uip rpa init`** to create new projects — never write `project.json` or scaffolding manually.
   - **Before creating, decide if a template is needed.** If the user names a template ("REFramework", "Robotic Enterprise Framework", "based on the X template"), an industry/domain pattern (SAP, ERP, banking, mainframe), or otherwise hints at a non-blank starter, run `uip rpa templates search --query "<term>" --output json` first. Selection rule against `Data[*]`:
     - **User named a specific non-Official template** (e.g. "Enhanced REFramework", "Lite ReFrameWork") AND a `Marketplace` item's `title` or `packageId` substring-matches the user's specific qualifier → ask the user (Official + that Marketplace item are both candidates). Do NOT auto-pick.
     - **Exactly one `source == "Official"` match AND user did not name a non-Official template** → use it; pass `--template-package-id <packageId> --template-package-version <version>` to `init`. Proceed without asking.
     - **Multiple `Official` matches OR only `Marketplace` matches** → present candidates (`packageId`, `version`, `source`, `title`) to the user and ask which to use. Never silently pick a Marketplace template.
     - **No matches** → fall back to a built-in `--template-id` and tell the user nothing was found.
   - Built-in `--template-id` keywords map without a search: `library` → `LibraryProcessTemplate`, `test automation` / `test project` → `TestAutomationProjectTemplate`, otherwise `BlankTemplate`. When `--template-package-id` is set, `--template-id` is ignored. Full decision flow: [environment-setup.md § Template selection](references/environment-setup.md#template-selection).
3. **Phase-gated validation: analyzer rules run at AUTHORING-phase start, not session start.** Three-phase validation:
   - **Authoring-phase start** (immediately before creating or editing any workflow file — `.cs` with `[Workflow]`/`[TestCase]`, or `.xaml`): `uip rpa analyzer-rules list --project-dir "<PROJECT_DIR>" --output json` to list the enabled Workflow Analyzer rules. Apply every `error` and `warning` rule during authoring so generated code passes `analyze` and `build` on the first attempt. Run once at this point; re-run only when project dependencies change. **DO NOT run at session start** — the call can take a minute or more (use `--scope <Activity|Workflow|Coded Workflow|Project>` to narrow if it times out, see [cli-reference.md § analyzer-rules list](references/cli-reference.md)). For capture-first tasks (target capture from manual test steps, dialog automation), this prerequisite is deferred until capture is complete — see § Capture-First Fast Path below.
   - **Per-file** (after every create or edit): run **both** validators in sequence — they catch disjoint error classes, neither alone is sufficient.
     1. `uip rpa validate --file-path "<FILE>" --project-dir "<PROJECT_DIR>" --output json` until 0 errors. Catches: structural XAML, missing references, analyzer rules, schema violations.
     2. Then `uip rpa build "<PROJECT_DIR>" --output json` until clean. Catches what `validate` misses: **unknown member names** (`NGetText.Value` when the property is `Text`), **invalid enum values** (`Operator="StartsWith"` when the enum has no such member), **member resolution / CacheMetadata failures**, attribute-form C# expression JIT failures. `validate` returns "no diagnostics found" for these; `build` reports them at compile time.
     3. Cap the combined loop at 5 fix attempts. Fix one thing per iteration; re-run both validators.
   - **Project-level end-goal** (before reporting done): the per-file step's project-level `build` already establishes compilability. A successful `uip rpa run` smoke test covers this too. Skip the standalone end-goal `build` only if the per-file `build` already passed clean on the project's current state.

   See [references/validation-guide.md](references/validation-guide.md).
4. **ALWAYS validate files as you go AND verify the project builds before declaring done.** After every create or edit: per-file `validate` to clean **and** project-level `build` to clean — both, in that order. `validate` clean alone is not "validated"; it cannot see member or enum errors. See [references/validation-guide.md](references/validation-guide.md).
5. **Prefer UiPath built-in activities** for Orchestrator integration, UI automation, and document handling. Prefer plain .NET / third-party packages for pure data transforms, HTTP calls, parsing.
6. **ALWAYS ensure required package dependencies are in `project.json`** before using their activities or services.
6a. **Pre-edit verification gate.** Two authoring actions are hard to roll back once `build` fails — verify before serialization, not after.
   - **Removing a dependency** — grep the project for usages before deleting an entry. A package may be the sole supplier of an activity used elsewhere (`MergePDFs` lives in the IntelligentOCR.StudioWeb family).
   - **Writing a new activity tag** — confirm via `uip rpa activities find --query "<verb>" --output json` and use the returned `ClassName`. Do not derive tag names from Studio display names. See [common-pitfalls.md § Common Activity Name Confusions](references/xaml/common-pitfalls.md#common-activity-name-confusions).
7. **For UI automation workflows**, MUST follow the target configuration workflow in [references/ui-automation-guide.md](references/ui-automation-guide.md). NEVER hand-write selectors — use `uia-configure-target` exclusively.
7a. **[UIA] Verify UIA prerequisites before invoking `uia-configure-target`.** UIA minimum is `26.4.1-preview` (source-of-truth: [uia-prerequisites.md](references/uia-prerequisites.md) — kept in sync with that file). Run the prerequisite check in that file. If `UiPath.UIAutomation.Activities` is below the minimum or `{PROJECT_DIR}/.local/docs/packages/UiPath.UIAutomation.Activities/skills/uia-configure-target/SKILL.md` is absent: ask the user to upgrade or fall back to indication authoring — never silently route to a non-existent skill path. If the plan header records `UI capture: indication-only`, skip `uia-configure-target` entirely and use indication authoring.
8. **Use `--output json`** on all CLI commands whose output is parsed programmatically.
8a. **`run` / `debug start` success/failure verdict comes from the outer `Result` (and equivalently the inner `HasErrors`), NEVER from any log entry's `Level`.** A successful workflow may emit `Log Message` activities at `Error` or `Warning` level as observability — those are workflow-emitted data, not CLI failures. Compile failures, validation failures, and unhandled runtime exceptions all flip `HasErrors` and propagate to the outer `Result`. Treating log-entry levels as a failure signal flips green runs to "failed" and burns retries on healthy workflows. See [cli-reference.md § run](references/cli-reference.md) and [debugging.md § Reading Debug Output Effectively](references/debugging.md#reading-debug-output-effectively).

### Execution Discipline (Both Modes)

**Run to completion — do not declare work done while plan tasks remain.** If a plan file exists at `docs/plans/*.md` referenced by this request (or discoverable there for this feature), read its header before acting and during every checkpoint.

- If the header has `Execution autonomy: autonomous`: continue until ALL plan task checkboxes are `[x]` OR a concrete item from the plan's `Stop conditions` section is hit.
- If the header has `Execution autonomy: interactive`, or no plan file exists: use judgment and confirm with the user on material decisions.
- Before declaring the task done, re-read the plan and enumerate any unchecked boxes. If unchecked tasks remain and no Stop condition was hit, keep going — do not summarize partial work as "Done".
- "Feels expensive", "many tool calls used", "natural pause point", "partial result looks usable", and "too complex to continue in one session" are **NOT** Stop conditions. Only the concrete hard blockers in the plan's `Stop conditions` section count.
- Plan decisions already made are authoritative. Do not `AskUserQuestion` about structure, file count, selector strategy, or capture approach when the plan specifies them — those questions belonged to the planner.

### Coded-Specific Rules

8. **[Coded] ALWAYS inherit from `CodedWorkflow`** base class for workflow and test case classes (NOT for Coded Source Files).
9. **[Coded] ALWAYS use `[Workflow]` or `[TestCase]` attribute** on the `Execute` method.
10. **[Coded] Update `project.json` entry points** when adding/removing workflow files in **Process** projects. **Tests and Library projects do NOT use `entryPoints`** — skip this step for those project types. Always update `fileInfoCollection` for test case files.
12. **[Coded] One workflow/test case class per file**, class name must match file name.
13. **[Coded] Namespace = sanitized project name** from `project.json`. Sanitize: remove spaces, replace hyphens with `_`, ensure valid C# identifier.
14. **[Coded] Entry method is always named `Execute`**.
15. **[Coded] Use Coded Source Files** for reusable code — plain `.cs` files without `CodedWorkflow` inheritance, no entry point.

### XAML-Specific Rules

16. **[XAML] Activity docs are the source of truth** — check `{projectRoot}/.local/docs/packages/{PackageId}/` first. Always.
17. **[XAML] MUST understand project structure** — read `project.json`, check expression language, scan existing patterns. NEVER generate XAML blind.
18. **[XAML] Start minimal, iterate to correct** — build one activity at a time, validate after each addition.
19. **[XAML] Fix errors by category** — Package → Structure → Type → Activity Properties → Logic.
20. **[XAML] ViewState handling depends on the operation.** When editing existing files, do NOT modify ViewState on nodes you are not changing. When generating new Flowchart/StateMachine/ProcessDiagram workflows, generate ViewState for each node (see [canvas-layout-guide.md](references/xaml/canvas-layout-guide.md)). For Sequences, ViewState is optional.
21. **[XAML] Reading `<Activity>.md` from `{PROJECT_DIR}/.local/docs/packages/...` is a precondition for `activities get-default-xaml` — for every activity, not just complex ones.** Workflow: (1) `activities find` → class name, (2) **read `<Activity>.md` first** and extract a property checklist (required + use-case-relevant), (3) `activities get-default-xaml` → starter element, (4) **diff your checklist against the starter and add what's missing** — an empty checklist means you skipped step 2, go back. Doc lookup order: primary `{PROJECT_DIR}/.local/docs/packages/<PackageId>/activities/<Activity>.md`; fallback `skills/uipath-rpa/references/activity-docs/<PackageId>/<closest-version>/<Activity>.md` for older package versions where `.local/docs` is empty. **Skip-tax — concrete:** `activities get-default-xaml` omits any property whose value equals the type default. For `NGetText` the starter is literally `<uix:NGetText HealingAgentBehavior="SameAsCard" />` with **zero** output properties — authoring from this alone produces `NGetText.Value="..."` (does not exist; the property is `Text`), which `validate` accepts and `build` rejects. For `NTypeInto` that's 2 of 20 properties hidden. **Self-exempting "this activity is simple — `LogMessage`, `Delay`, `GetText`, I can author from the starter alone" is the failure mode.** The MD read is the only check. Full procedure: [xaml/xaml-basics-and-rules.md § Activity Property Surface](references/xaml/xaml-basics-and-rules.md#activity-property-surface-and-starter-xaml).
21a. **[XAML] Built-in WF activities are not exempt from Rule 21.** `System.Activities.Statements.*` (`If`, `While`, `DoWhile`, `TryCatch`, `Switch`, `ForEach<T>`, `Pick`, `Sequence`, `Parallel`, `ParallelForEach<T>`) ship inside `System.Activities`. Their `<Activity>.md` docs live under `references/activity-docs/UiPath.System.Activities/<version>/activities/`; `activities get-default-xaml` returns the canonical Studio shape with `<Sequence>` already inside `If.Then` / `If.Else` / `While` body / etc. "`If` is a primitive I already know" → bare-branch XAML.
22. **[XAML] MUST read [references/xaml/xaml-basics-and-rules.md](references/xaml/xaml-basics-and-rules.md)** before generating or editing any XAML.
23. **[XAML] NEVER change `expressionLanguage` or `targetFramework` on an existing project.** Both fields in `project.json` are fixed at creation time and apply to every XAML file in the project — flipping `expressionLanguage` (VisualBasic ↔ CSharp) invalidates every expression, and flipping `targetFramework` (Windows ↔ Portable/cross-platform, or Legacy) invalidates package references and activity compatibility. **Do not attempt in-place conversion.** If the user wants to convert an existing project, confirm with them, copy the project to a temporary folder, create a new project via `uip rpa init --expression-language <VisualBasic|CSharp> --target-framework <Windows|Portable|Legacy>`, make sure all the defined workflows in the old project have an equivalent in the new project. Delete the copied project just after the new project has been successfully generated and the user agree with the changes.
24. **[XAML] Wrap every container-activity body/branch in `<Sequence>` — even single-activity bodies.** Studio's designer expects the wrap as a drop zone; Studio's emitter produces it. `validate` and `build` accept the bare form, so neither catches missing wrappers. Applies to creation and editing alike. Slots include `If.Then`/`If.Else`, `While`/`DoWhile` body, `ForEach.Body`, `TryCatch.Try`/`Catch`/`Finally`, `Switch.Default` + each case, `PickBranch.Trigger`/`Action`, `NApplicationCard.Body`. Full table with examples: [xaml/xaml-basics-and-rules.md § Container Activity Bodies — Wrap in Sequence](references/xaml/xaml-basics-and-rules.md#container-activity-bodies--wrap-in-sequence).

## Coded Workflows Quick Reference

Coded workflows use standard C# development: create file → write code → validate → run. Activity discovery (`activities find`, `activities get-default-xaml`) is XAML-specific — for coded mode, check `{projectRoot}/.local/docs/packages/{PackageId}/coded/coded-api.md` first for service API docs, then fall back to `packages inspect`. See [coded/inspect-package-guide.md](references/coded/inspect-package-guide.md).

### Three Types of .cs Files

| Type | Base Class | Attribute | Entry Point | Purpose |
|------|-----------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Coded Workflow** | `CodedWorkflow` | `[Workflow]` | Process only | Executable automation logic |
| **Coded Test Case** | `CodedWorkflow` | `[TestCase]` | Process only | Automated test with assertions |
| **Coded Source File** | None (plain C#) | None | No | Reusable models, helpers, utilities, hooks |

### Service-to-Package Mapping

Each service on `CodedWorkflow` requires its NuGet package in `project.json`. Without it: `CS0103`.

| Service Property | Required Package |
|-----------------|------------------|
| `system` | `UiPath.System.Activities` |
| `testing` | `UiPath.Testing.Activities` |
| `uiAutomation` | `UiPath.UIAutomation.Activities` |
| `excel` | `UiPath.Excel.Activities` |
| `word` | `UiPath.Word.Activities` |
| `powerpoint` | `UiPath.Presentations.Activities` |
| `mail` | `UiPath.Mail.Activities` |
| `office365` | `UiPath.MicrosoftOffice365.Activities` |
| `google` | `UiPath.GSuite.Activities` |

For infrastructure/cloud packages (azure, gcp, aws, azureAD, citrix, hyperv, etc.), see [coded/codedworkflow-reference.md](references/coded/codedworkflow-reference.md).

For IS connectors from coded workflows via `ConnectorConnection.ExecuteAsync`: `UiPath.IntegrationService.Activities` — see [coded/integration-service-guide.md](references/coded/integration-service-guide.md).

### CodedWorkflow Base Class

All workflow/test case files inherit from `CodedWorkflow`, providing built-in methods (`Log`, `Delay`, `RunWorkflow`), service properties, and the `workflows` property for strongly-typed invocation. Extendable with Before/After hooks via `IBeforeAfterRun`.

## XAML Workflows Quick Reference

XAML workflows follow a **discovery-first, phase-based approach**: Discovery → Generate/Edit → Validate & Fix → Response. See [references/xaml/workflow-guide.md](references/xaml/workflow-guide.md) for the full phase workflow.

### Workflow Types

| Type | When to Use |
|------|-------------|
| **Sequence** | Linear step-by-step logic; most common for simple automations |
| **Flowchart** | Branching/looping logic with multiple decision points |
| **State Machine** | Long-running processes with distinct states and transitions |
| **Long Running Workflow** | BPMN-style horizontal flow; event-driven processes with long waits |

### Expression Language

Check `expressionLanguage` in `project.json`. VB.NET uses `[brackets]` for expressions; C# uses `CSharpValue<T>` / `CSharpReference<T>`. Default for new XAML projects is VB.NET.

### Key CLI Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `activities find --query "<keyword>"` | Discover activities by keyword |
| `activities get-default-xaml --activity-class-name "<class>"` | Get starter XAML for an activity |
| `analyzer-rules list --project-dir "<dir>"` | List enabled Workflow Analyzer rules — run before generating |
| `validate --file-path "<file>"` | Per-file static validation (structure, references, analyzer rules) |
| `build "<PROJECT_DIR>"` | Compile-time validation (member names, enum values, JIT expressions) — run after `validate` is clean |

### Common Activities

| Activity | Package | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| Use Application/Browser | `UiPath.UIAutomation.Activities` | Scope for all UI automation actions |
| Click | `UiPath.UIAutomation.Activities` | Click a UI element |
| Type Into | `UiPath.UIAutomation.Activities` | Type text into a field |
| Get Text | `UiPath.UIAutomation.Activities` | Extract text from a UI element |
| If | built-in | Conditional branching |
| Assign | built-in | Set variable/argument values |
| For Each | built-in | Iterate over a collection |
| Invoke Workflow File | built-in | Call another workflow file |

### XAML File Anatomy

The XAML file anatomy template (namespace declarations, root Activity element, body structure) is in [xaml/xaml-basics-and-rules.md](references/xaml/xaml-basics-and-rules.md) — read it before generating or editing any XAML.

### Multi-Screen UI Automation Workflows

For XAML workflows spanning multiple capture screens, add each screen's activities to the workflow as its targets get registered in the OR — validating with `validate` after each batch. See [uia-configure-target-workflows.md § Multi-Step UI Flows](references/uia-configure-target-workflows.md#multi-step-ui-flows) for the capture loop and the Complete-then-advance rule.

## Resolving Packages & Activity Docs

Follow this flow whenever you need to use an activity package:

### Step 1 — Ensure the package is installed

Check `project.json` → `dependencies` for the required package.

**Always query versions with `--include-prerelease`.** Many UiPath activity packages ship as `-preview` between stable releases, and the latest preview routinely contains new activities, fixed signatures, and updated `.local/docs` content that activity generation depends on. Without the flag, the listing hides these and the agent will pick a stale stable.

- **If present** → note the installed version. Then list available versions with `--include-prerelease` and compare:
  - If a newer version (stable or preview) exists, **inform the user**: state the installed version, the latest available version, and that newer packages offer the best support for activity generation (latest activity surface, accurate `.local/docs`, fewer signature mismatches). Ask whether to upgrade. **Never force-upgrade** an already-installed package.
  - If the installed version is already the latest, proceed to Step 2.
- **If absent** → install the latest version returned by `packages versions --include-prerelease` (preview is acceptable):

```bash
uip rpa packages versions --package-id <PackageId> --include-prerelease --project-dir "<PROJECT_DIR>" --output json
uip rpa packages install --packages '[{"id":"<PackageId>","version":"<LATEST_VERSION>"}]' --project-dir "<PROJECT_DIR>" --output json
```

### Step 2 — Find activity docs (priority order)

1. **Check `{PROJECT_DIR}/.local/docs/packages/{PackageId}/`** — auto-generated, most accurate. Use `Glob` + `Read` (not `Grep` — `.local/` is gitignored).
2. **Fall back to bundled references** at `references/activity-docs/{PackageId}/` — pick the version folder closest to what is installed.

## UI Automation References

**MUST read [references/ui-automation-guide.md](references/ui-automation-guide.md) before any UI automation work** — mode-specific UIA patterns (coded vs XAML).

Additional UIA procedures and guides:
- [uia-prerequisites.md](references/uia-prerequisites.md) — Package version requirements
- [uia-debug-workflow.md](references/uia-debug-workflow.md) — Running and debugging UI automation workflows
- [uia-selector-recovery.md](references/uia-selector-recovery.md) — Fixing selectors that fail at runtime
- [uia-configure-target-workflows.md](references/uia-configure-target-workflows.md) — Target configuration workflow, multi-step UI flows, and indication fallback

## Completion Output

**Before reporting "done", verify the plan is complete.** If a plan file at `docs/plans/*.md` drove this work:
1. Re-read the plan and scan its task checkboxes.
2. If any `[ ]` boxes remain AND the plan's header says `Execution autonomy: autonomous` AND no `Stop conditions` item was hit — **do not report done**. Resume execution on the next unchecked task.
3. If unchecked boxes remain because a Stop condition was hit, name the exact stop-condition item in the report.
4. If the plan is fully checked off, or execution autonomy is `interactive`, proceed to the report format below.

When you finish a task, report to the user:
1. **What was done** — files created, edited, or deleted (list file paths)
2. **Validation status** — per-file `validate` result (all files passed, or remaining errors) **and** project-level `uip rpa build` result. Both must be clean to claim verification — `validate` clean alone is insufficient (it does not detect unknown member names or invalid enum values). If `build` has not run since the last edit, say so explicitly rather than claiming success.
3. **Plan completion** — which task checkboxes in `docs/plans/*.md` are now `[x]`; list any still `[ ]` and, for each, the Stop-condition item that interrupted it (or "not reached" if execution was cut short another way)
4. **How to run** — the `uip rpa run` (or `uip rpa debug start`) command (if applicable)
5. **Next steps** — follow-up actions (configure connections, add OR elements, fill placeholders)
6. **Trouble?** — if the user hit issues during this session, mention: "If something didn't work as expected, use `/uipath-feedback` to send a report."

Do NOT use framing like "complete", "done", "finished", or "the automation is built" unless every plan task is checked off. "Partial", "stopped at <task N>", or "blocked by <stop condition>" is the honest framing otherwise.
