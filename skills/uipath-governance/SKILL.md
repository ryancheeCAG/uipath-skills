# UiPath Governance

> **Preview** — skill is under active development; surface and behavior may change.

Uber skill for UiPath governance authoring. Two backing CLI surfaces:

| Surface | Governs | CLI |
|---|---|---|
| **AOps product policy** | Product feature behavior — what Studio / StudioX / Assistant / Robot / AI Trust Layer / Agent Builder can do at design-time / runtime | `uip gov aops-policy` |
| **Access policy** (`ToolUsePolicy`) | Resource/tool-use boundary — when an Actor Process invokes a child Resource (Agent / Maestro / Flow / RPA / API / Case Management), is the call allowed? | `uip gov access-policy` |

Both surfaces share verbs (`block`, `restrict`, `deny`, `allow`, `require`, `enforce`). The same English sentence often maps to either layer, so this skill **classifies first** and only then routes to the matching mechanic.

## When to Use This Skill

Activate on **any** governance / policy / rule intent — even when the user did not name the underlying CLI:

- `policy / rule / guardrail / govern / gate / control` requests
- `block / restrict / deny / disable / disallow` an action, model, app, URL, agent, flow, or process
- `require / enforce / mandate` a behavior or rule
- `allow only / permit only / limit to / restrict to` X
- `who can / which … can / on behalf of` — actor- or identity-shaped governance
- `compliance / posture / audit` framing on top of policies
- `.uipolicy` file path, `compliance pack`, `apply pack`
- Standard names: `ISO 42001`, `ISO 27001`, `HIPAA`, `SOC 2`
- `check compliance`, `compliance posture`, `posture against`, `drift check`
- `is my tenant compliant`, `am I compliant with`
- `organization-wide`, `all tenants`, `entire org`, `across all tenants` — org-scope full apply

**Sibling redirects:**
- Platform ops (auth, Orchestrator resources, packaging, deploy) → `uipath-platform`
- Authoring agents / workflows / RPA themselves → `uipath-agents` / `uipath-rpa` / `uipath-maestro-flow`

## Critical Rules

1. **Classify before authoring.** First action on any governance request is to classify intent into Branch A (AOps) or Branch B (Access). Use the priors in [`references/disambiguation-guide.md`](./references/disambiguation-guide.md). Never start `create` / `update` / `delete` until classification is settled — by user wording or by the [disambiguation question](#disambiguation-question).
2. **Classification lives at the top.** Mechanic libraries assume the branch is chosen. Do not let those flows ask "did you mean the other branch?" — that question belongs here.
3. **One branch per mutation.** A single user request produces a policy on one branch only. If the user wants both, run two sequential flows with two confirmation gates.
4. **Each mechanic owns its own Critical Rules.** Once routed, follow the branch's rules — do not relax them from this top level.
5. **Never apply a compliance pack without gap scan + user confirmation.** Run gap scan first, show the plan, require `y` before any policy is created.
6. **Never skip the deploy record.** Write it unconditionally after any apply — even if some clauses failed.
7. **Always `uip login` before any `uip gov …` command.** `evaluate` (Access) additionally requires tenant-scoped login — see [`access-policy-overview-guide.md` § Critical Rules](./references/access-policy/access-policy-overview-guide.md#critical-rules).
8. **Never fabricate UUIDs.** Resolve every named user / group / process / agent / flow / robot / tenant via the relevant branch's lookups.

## Workflow

1. **Classify the intent silently — never announce routing to the user.** Internal flow labels (AOps / Access / Compliance pack) are implementation details; the user sees only the outcome. Read [`references/disambiguation-guide.md`](./references/disambiguation-guide.md) — it lists the strong signals for each flow, the phrase patterns that need disambiguation, and the canonical worked example. If a strong signal matches, route silently. If the phrasing is ambiguous (matches AOps or Access), ask the [disambiguation question](#disambiguation-question) and wait for a digit reply. If the user replies with anything other than `1` or `2`, treat it as a re-statement of intent and re-classify. **Do not run any CLI command before classification is settled** — the disambiguation question itself does not need `uip`, and an unrelated request (platform ops, agent authoring) must redirect to a sibling skill before any setup happens here. If the request contains a standard name (`ISO 42001`, `ISO 27001`, `HIPAA`, `SOC 2`), `apply pack`, `compliance posture`, `drift check`, `am I compliant`, `is my tenant compliant`, `what packs are available`, `what packs are configured`, `which standards are enabled`, `organization-wide`, or `disable pack` → route silently to the appropriate compliance-pack plugin. Read `partial-apply/planning.md` for scoped requests; `coverage/impl.md` for posture checks; `catalog/impl.md` for discovery; `query/impl.md` for information queries; `full-apply/impl.md` after confirming the posture plan; `disable/impl.md` for removal; `catalog/impl.md` + `state list` for listing currently configured packs.
2. **Verify `uip` and login** *(only after classification routes to a governance flow).*
   ```bash
   which uip && uip --version
   uip login status --output json
   ```
   If not installed: `npm install -g @uipath/cli`. If not logged in: `uip login` (`--authority <URL>` for non-prod). For Access `evaluate`, login MUST be tenant-scoped.
3. **Route to the chosen mechanic** and follow its flow end-to-end.
   - AOps product policy → [`references/aops-policy/aops-policy-overview-guide.md`](./references/aops-policy/aops-policy-overview-guide.md)
   - Access ToolUsePolicy → [`references/access-policy/access-policy-overview-guide.md`](./references/access-policy/access-policy-overview-guide.md)
   - Compliance pack → use plugin routing from step 1 above (catalog / coverage / full-apply / partial-apply / disable / query)

## Disambiguation Question

When the user's intent fits both branches, render exactly this numbered list (no `AskUserQuestion`, no table) and wait for a digit reply:

```markdown
### Which layer should this rule govern?

1. **Govern the product** — control what Studio / StudioX / Assistant / Robot / AI Trust Layer / Agent Builder *can do* (e.g. block ChatGPT inside Studio, enforce Workflow Analyzer, disable a Marketplace widget). Backed by `uip gov aops-policy`.
2. **Govern resource/tool use** — control which Actor Processes / identities can *invoke* which child Resource as a tool (e.g. block agents tagged `Sandbox` from being called, only let the finance group trigger this Flow). Backed by `uip gov access-policy`.

Reply with the number.
```

The canonical ambiguous prompt is *"Block ChatGPT for my finance team using Studio."* See [`references/disambiguation-guide.md`](./references/disambiguation-guide.md#worked-example--the-canonical-ambiguous-prompt) for the worked-out reasoning of why both interpretations produce a working but different artifact.

## Anti-patterns

- Do NOT skip the disambiguation question when the phrasing fits both branches. Mechanic libraries assume the branch is chosen and will not catch wrong-branch routing.
- Do NOT hand off to a mechanic, then ask "did you mean the other branch?". That question must happen at this top level.
- Do NOT merge AOps and Access intent into one policy. Different artifacts, different CLIs, different schemas.
- Do NOT activate this skill for platform ops. Route to `uipath-platform`.
- Do NOT propose skill edits when intent doesn't map to either branch. Ask the user to clarify.
- Do NOT use `deployed-policy list` for gap detection — it returns all rules in priority order, not the merged effective value. Use `deployed-policy get <licenseType> <productName> <tenantId>` to get the single effective merged policy.
- Do NOT skip writing the deploy record even if apply partially fails.
- For compliance pack posture analysis, use `uip gov compliance-packs state coverage` — do NOT use `aops-policy deployed-policy` commands; those are for AOps policy debugging (Branch A), not compliance pack flows.
- For full pack configuration, use `state enable` — do NOT manually call `aops-policy create` for each product; that path is only for partial/scoped configuration.
- NEVER claim a tenant is "compliant" with a standard — only that recommended settings are configured. Compliance status is determined by the customer's auditor.
