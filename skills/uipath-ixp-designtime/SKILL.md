# UiPath IXP Document Extraction Assistant

Skill for working with UiPath IXP (Intelligent eXtraction Platform) projects — creating projects, uploading documents, reviewing predictions, and improving extraction quality.

## When to Use This Skill

- User asks to create an IXP project, upload documents, or train a document extraction model
- User asks to label, review, or confirm document predictions
- User asks to improve extraction scores, prompts, or field instructions
- User asks to publish or manage IXP model versions
- User provides a taxonomy file to import into a project
- User asks for the project taxonomy at a specific trained model version — what the schema looked like when version N was published (use `deployments get-taxonomy <project-name> --version <N>`)

## When NOT to Use This Skill — defer to uipath-maestro-flow

This skill covers standalone IXP-project work. STOP and invoke the `uipath-maestro-flow` skill instead when any of these hold:

- The user asks which IxP / document-extraction models, extractors, or nodes are available **to a `.flow` or Maestro flow** (a registry-listing question, not IXP-project management).
- The request is about adding, wiring, or referencing an IxP node **inside a flow**.
- The working context is a `.flow` file or a Maestro flow rather than a standalone IXP project.

Do not answer these from this skill. Re-activate `uipath-maestro-flow` and follow the commands it documents. This overrides Critical Rule 1.

## Critical Rules

1. **ONLY use `uip ixp` CLI commands as documented in this skill** — do NOT use curl, do NOT call REST APIs directly, do NOT grep/read source code, do NOT explore the codebase. (Exception: defer flow/Maestro registry questions to `uipath-maestro-flow` — see *When NOT to Use This Skill* above.)
2. **Run workflows end-to-end automatically** — do NOT ask the user to do individual steps.
3. **Always use `--output json`** when parsing CLI output programmatically.
4. **Use `/tmp/ixp/<project-name>/` as the working directory with this structure:**
   ```
   /tmp/ixp/<project-name>/
   ├── docs/         # Document files (<document-id>.pdf, .png, …) — downloaded once, reused across sessions
   ├── taxonomies/   # Taxonomy snapshots (v1.json, v2.json, …) — new version after each update-prompts
   └── prompts/      # Instruction update payloads (field_updates.json, group_updates.json, …)
   ```
   At the start of any workflow: `mkdir -p /tmp/ixp/<project-name>/{docs,taxonomies,prompts}`. If the directory already exists from a previous session, **reuse existing files** — do not re-download documents that are already present. Do NOT use the Write tool for `/tmp/ixp/` paths — on Windows it resolves to a different location than bash.
5. **Use heredocs for `--updates`** — for `fields update-prompts --updates` and `groups update-prompts --updates`, use heredocs (`cat > /tmp/ixp/<project-name>/prompts/field_updates.json << 'EOF' ... EOF`) then `"$(cat /tmp/ixp/<project-name>/prompts/field_updates.json)"`.
6. **Never use `UID` as a variable name** — it is a readonly shell variable. Use `DOC_ID`, `DOCUMENT_ID`, etc.
7. **Always use the project `Name`, never the `Title`** — the `project list` output has both `Name` (e.g., `my_invoices-f1afa9ef-ixp`) and `Title` (e.g., `My_Invoices`). All CLI commands require the `Name` (the lowercase slug with UUID and `-ixp` suffix), NOT the `Title`.
8. **Confirm at field level, not document level** — review each predicted field individually. Confirm only the fields that are correct using `labelling confirm --fields`. Fields with wrong predictions are left unannotated. **`--corrections` is ONLY for OCR-mangled values** — the prediction found the right field in the right location and the bytes-on-page are right, but the text was garbled (e.g., `MSIÓÓÓ601020/` → `MSI0601020`). Do NOT use `--corrections` to flip a wrong boolean, fix a wrong inferred/computed value, or change any value where the prediction itself was the wrong answer — those are NOT CONFIRMED. Overriding a non-OCR prediction is manual extraction (forbidden by rule 11).
9. **Do NOT manually extract values** — all labelling goes through `labelling confirm` with predictions from IXP.
10. **Max 8 documents for taxonomy suggestion** — the suggest-taxonomy endpoint accepts at most 8 attachment references.
11. **Claude is the reviewer, not the extractor** — IXP generates predictions, Claude validates them. For each document, review predicted field values against the document file (Read tool handles PDF, PNG, JPG, etc.). Confirm correct fields (`labelling confirm --fields`), correct OCR-mangled values (`--corrections`), and skip wrong fields. Do NOT manually extract values. If a field's F1 is low, improve the **prompt** so IXP predicts better values.
12. **Confirm a field as missing by listing it in `confirm --fields`, only when IXP also predicted nothing** — `labellings confirm --fields f1,f2,f3` treats every listed field uniformly: if IXP predicted a value, it's confirmed; if IXP predicted nothing for a listed field, a missing marker is written. The explicit listing IS the confirmation that the empty state is intentional. Only include a field in `--fields` for the missing case when IXP itself predicted no value (or an empty value) AND the field is genuinely absent from the document. If IXP predicted a wrong value, leave the field NOT CONFIRMED (omit it from `--fields`) — choosing "missing" yourself is the same kind of extractor decision rule 11 forbids. Use `labellings mark-missing` only as a fallback when `confirm --fields` is a no-op for a field you expected it to handle — this happens when the field has a prior annotation but doesn't appear in the current `get-predictions` output for that document (e.g., model behavior or the taxonomy changed between iterations). In that case, `mark-missing` reaches the stale annotation and overwrites it with a missing marker; `confirm` can't.

## Quick Start

1. Run `uip ixp projects list --output json` to see existing projects
2. To create a new project: follow [Project Setup Guide](references/project-setup-guide.md)
3. To improve an existing project: follow [Improve Prompts Guide](references/improve-prompts-guide.md)
4. To label documents on an existing project: follow [Label Documents Guide](references/label-documents-guide.md)

If the user provides a taxonomy file, use `--skip-taxonomy` and `import-taxonomy` (Option B in the Project Setup guide).

## Task Navigation

| User request | Action |
|-------------|--------|
| "Create an IXP project" / "Upload documents to a new project" | [Project Setup Guide](references/project-setup-guide.md) — **new** projects only (uploads + taxonomy in one call). For **existing** projects, see the "Upload a document" row below. |
| "Import this taxonomy" / provides a taxonomy file | [Project Setup Guide](references/project-setup-guide.md) — Option B (`--skip-taxonomy` + `import-taxonomy`) |
| "Label documents" / "Review predictions" | [Label Documents Guide](references/label-documents-guide.md) |
| "Improve scores" / "Fix prompts" / "Improve F1" | [Improve Prompts Guide](references/improve-prompts-guide.md) |
| "Publish the model" / "Tag as live" | `uip ixp projects publish <project-name> --output json` |
| "Roll back to a previous version" / "Restore version N" | `uip ixp projects publish <project-name> --model-version <N> --output json` — re-publishes an earlier version. Get available versions from `uip ixp projects list-models <project-name> --output json`. |
| "Show metrics" / "What are the scores?" | `uip ixp projects get-metrics <project-name> --output json` |
| "List projects" | `uip ixp projects list --output json` |
| "Configure the model" | `uip ixp projects configure-model <project-name> [options] --output json` |
| "Delete a project" / "Remove this project" | `uip ixp projects delete <project-name> --confirm-data-loss --output json` — **permanent and irreversible**; removes the project's documents, taxonomy, and trained models. Requires `--confirm-data-loss`. |
| "Upload a document" / "Add documents to an existing project" | `uip ixp documents upload <project-name> <file> --output json` — see [CLI Reference § Uploading documents](references/cli-reference.md#uploading-documents-to-an-existing-project). One file per call; loop for multiple. For brand-new projects use `projects create` instead. |
| "Delete a document" / "Remove a document" | `uip ixp documents delete <project-name> <document-id> --output json` — irreversible, triggers retrain. To delete by filename, look up the `DocumentId` via `documents list` (the `Filename` column shows the original upload name). |
| "Add / delete / rename a field group" | `uip ixp groups {add,delete,rename} <project-name> --name <name> ... --output json` — see [CLI Reference § Groups](references/cli-reference.md#groups). `groups add` requires `--instructions` and `--fields '<json>'` with at least one field. `delete` requires `--confirm-data-loss`. |
| "Add / edit / rename / delete a data type" | `uip ixp data-types {add,update-instructions,rename,delete} <project-name> --name <name> ... --output json` — see [CLI Reference § Data Types](references/cli-reference.md#data-types). `add` requires `--kind` (text/date/money/number/boolean/choice) and `--instructions`. `--input-value` (exact-match/inferred) is required only for `--kind text` and `--kind choice`; the other kinds don't have this property and the CLI rejects the flag for them. `delete` requires `--confirm-data-loss` because referencing fields break. |
| "Add / delete / rename / retype a field" | `uip ixp fields {add,delete,rename,change-type} <project-name> --group <name> --field <name> ... --output json` — see [CLI Reference § Fields](references/cli-reference.md#fields). `change-type` deletes annotations and requires `--confirm-data-loss`. |
| "Mark a field as missing for a document" | Include the field's id in `uip ixp labellings confirm <project-name> <document-id> --fields <ids> --output json` alongside any content fields you're confirming. When IXP's prediction for that field is empty, the explicit listing writes a missing marker; when it has content, the content is confirmed. **Only list a field for the missing case if IXP also predicted nothing for it.** See Critical Rule 12. Use `labellings mark-missing` only as a fallback when `confirm --fields` is a no-op for a field you expected it to handle — typically a field with a prior annotation that the current prediction no longer includes (model or taxonomy changed between iterations). |
| "Undo / unconfirm a wrong confirmation" | `uip ixp labellings unconfirm <project-name> <document-id> --fields <ids> --output json` — rolls back an earlier `confirm` or `mark-missing` for the listed fields. Every other annotation on the document is carried forward. |
| "Set overall extraction instructions" / "Update project prompt" | `uip ixp projects update-prompt <project-name> --prompt "<text>" --output json` — replaces the taxonomy-wide prompt (the "Overall extraction instructions" field in the IXP UI). Distinct from `fields update-prompts` (per-field) and `groups update-prompts` (per-field-group). |
| "How is this project performing?" / "What's the F1?" | `uip ixp projects get-metrics <project-name> --output json` (+ `list-models` for the live version). Report in order: (1) published version — live/pinned + `TrainedTime` (`Tags[]` Name=`live`, `Models[]` Pinned); (2) per-group scores from `FieldGroups[]` (F1/Precision/Recall); (3) per-field scores from `Fields[]`, sorted lowest-F1 first. State numbers plainly; no "good enough" judgement unless asked; route low scores to [Improve Prompts Guide](references/improve-prompts-guide.md). Answer from these two calls only — no ad-hoc discovery (Critical Rule #1). |
| "Describe this project" / "What's in it?" | Three calls, reported in order: (1) identity — `Title`/`Name` from `uip ixp projects get <project-name> --output json`; (2) current model — live/pinned + `TrainedTime` from `list-models`; (3) taxonomy — label-group/field counts from `uip ixp projects get-taxonomy <project-name> --output json`. Fold in performance (above) only if asked. Do NOT page `documents list` (paginated, no total) or read deployment bindings. Answer from these calls only (Critical Rule #1). |

## Common Pitfalls

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Metrics don't change after a prompt update | Re-evaluation hasn't completed | Wait ~2 minutes for retrain. |
| ModelVersion doesn't advance | Retrain still in progress | Any change to model inputs (labellings OR instructions) triggers a full retrain. Wait ~2 min then retry. |
| Field instructions conflict with label_def instructions | `fields update-prompts` only edits per-field instructions, NOT the parent label_def instructions | Before iterating, read the label_def `instructions` and update them with `groups update-prompts` if they contradict the per-field prompts. |

## Unsupported Capabilities

These requests fall outside the skill. Recognise the request, reply with the standard response, route the user. Do NOT enter discovery (`uip --help`, grep, source reading) — see Critical Rule #1.

| User request | Standard response |
|--------------|-------------------|
| "Create a model" / "create a project" | **Documents or a taxonomy supplied →** use the [Project Setup Guide](references/project-setup-guide.md) (this skill creates the project from them). **Otherwise →** "I work on existing IXP projects rather than creating them from scratch. Create one in-product: https://docs.uipath.com/ixp/automation-cloud/latest/user-guide/managing-projects — then I can label, review, and improve it." |
| "Upload these files" / "add documents" | **Project named / already in context →** supported; upload it (see the "Upload a document" row in Task Navigation). **Otherwise →** "Name an existing project and I'll upload it — or upload in-product (e.g. for a new project): https://docs.uipath.com/ixp/automation-cloud/latest/user-guide/building-and-deploying-models." |
| "Deploy this model" / "push to staging / production / folder / environment / tenant" | "I don't drive deployment to folders, environments, or tenants — that's a product-side flow: https://docs.uipath.com/ixp/automation-cloud/latest/user-guide/building-and-deploying-models. I can publish a model version with `uip ixp projects publish <project-name> --output json`, but binding it to a folder/environment is done in-product." |
| "Give X access" / "share this project" / "change roles or permissions" | "Access, roles, and permissions are managed in-product, not through this skill: https://docs.uipath.com/ixp/automation-cloud/latest/overview/managing-access." |
| "Use this model in my automation / workflow / agent" / "call the extractor from a process" | "Consuming a published model inside an automation is an authoring task outside this skill. See https://docs.uipath.com/ixp/automation-cloud/latest/user-guide/building-and-consuming-a-workflow." |
| "Mine these emails / communications" / "set up Communications Mining" | "Communications Mining is a separate IXP capability this skill doesn't cover (this skill is document extraction). See https://docs.uipath.com/ixp/automation-cloud/latest/cm-user-guide/introduction-to-uipath-communication-mining." |
| "Monitor the deployed model" / "how many docs did it process?" / "runtime throughput or incidents" | "Runtime/operational monitoring of a deployed model lives in Orchestrator, not this skill: https://docs.uipath.com/orchestrator/automation-cloud/latest/user-guide/about-monitoring. For designtime scores use `get-metrics` (see 'Show metrics')." |
