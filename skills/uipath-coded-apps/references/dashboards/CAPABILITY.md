# Dashboard Capability

## When to Use This Capability
- User wants a dashboard, analytics view, KPI summary, or metric report
- NLP prompt describes data to visualize ("agent success rates", "queue SLA", "governance violations")
- Iterating on an existing dashboard (adding widgets, changing chart types)

## Critical Rules
1. Read `primitives/auth-context.md` BEFORE any SDK or Insights API call
2. ALWAYS derive a plain-language plan before writing code — read `primitives/build-plan.md`
3. HALT at the approval gate — do not scaffold until user confirms the plan
4. Route each metric to SDK or Insights via `primitives/data-router.md` — never guess the source
5. NEVER hardcode tenant IDs, org names, or folder paths in generated code
6. NEVER auto-deploy — deploy pipeline always requires explicit user confirmation
7. Use the HTTP client from `primitives/insights-client.md` for all Insights API calls
8. All tokens flow through `useAuth()` — never store tokens in state, localStorage, or env vars at runtime
9. Run `tsc --noEmit` before claiming success
10. Every list call paginates — ≤50 rows per page, never load all
