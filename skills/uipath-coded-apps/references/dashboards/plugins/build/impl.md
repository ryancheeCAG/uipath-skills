# Dashboard Build Plugin

Full pipeline: NLP prompt → plan approval → scaffold → widgets → validate → preview.

## Tool-Use Budget
≤ 10 tool calls for a 6-widget dashboard. Never exceed 15 total.

| Phase | Calls | How |
|---|---|---|
| 1 Boot | 1 block | 4 reads issued simultaneously |
| 2 Preflight | 1 Bash | `uip login status` |
| 3–5 Derive + Plan + Approve | 0 | In-context, no tools |
| 6 Scaffold | 1 Bash | cp + .env.local + npm ci combined |
| 7 Widgets | 1 block | N Write calls in parallel (no template reads) |
| 8 Validate | 1 Bash | `tsc --noEmit` |
| **Total** | **≤ 6 blocks** | |

## Execution Rules — Non-negotiable

1. **Never spawn subagents.** Do not use `TaskCreate`, `Agent`, or any dispatching tool. Every phase executes in this session.
2. **Never read scaffold source files during Phase 7.** The template's `useInsights.ts`, `insights-client.ts`, `DashboardShell.tsx`, etc. are known — do not re-read them to understand their API.
3. **Never read widget template files.** Use Widget Recipes from `insights-catalog.md` directly.

## Narration Rules — What Users See

This skill serves end users, not developers. Never show npm output, TypeScript errors, file paths, bash commands, or technical logs.

**Show exactly these messages at these moments:**

| When | Show |
|------|------|
| User approves the plan (before Phase 6) | `⚙ Building your dashboard — this usually takes about 30 seconds…` |
| Phase 6 running | *(silence — do not narrate commands or output)* |
| Phase 7 running | *(silence — do not narrate file writes)* |
| tsc passes (Phase 8) | Show the final summary immediately — see Summary Format below |

**If tsc fails:** Fix errors silently (max 2 attempts). Never mention TypeScript to the user. If you cannot fix after 2 attempts, say: "I ran into a configuration issue — please run `npm install` in your project folder and try again."

**If npm ci fails:** Say: "Dependencies are downloading — this can take a moment on first run." Retry once with `npm install`. Do not show npm output.

**If the dev server fails to start:** Include in the summary: "(Note: run `npm run dev` to start the local preview.)" — do not diagnose it further.

**Never say:** "Writing widget files", "Running tsc --noEmit", "Phase 6", "scaffold", "package.json", "useInsights", or any other implementation detail.

## Phase 1 — Boot (**MANDATORY: one parallel block, all 4 reads simultaneously**)

> **This is the single biggest performance lever in the pipeline.**
> Reading files sequentially costs ~8s per file in API round-trips (32s+ total).
> Issuing all 4 in one parallel block costs ~5s total — a 6× speedup.
>
> **Rule:** Issue exactly ONE message containing all four Read tool calls at the same time,
> with NO text output before they complete. Do not read them one at a time.

Issue these four Read calls in a single parallel message now:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `../../primitives/auth-context.md` | Auth resolution |
| `../../primitives/build-plan.md` | Plan format + startTime constants |
| `../../primitives/data-router.md` | SDK vs Insights routing |
| `../../insights-catalog.md` | API catalog + **Widget Recipes** (used in Phase 7) |

## Phase 2 — Preflight (1 Bash)
```bash
uip login status --output json
```
Check `Data.Status == "Logged in"`. If not → stop, tell user to run `uip login`.

Extract from response (fields are under `Data.`, not top-level):
- `Data.Organization` → ORG
- `Data.Tenant` → TENANT
- `Data.BaseUrl` → DATA_BASE_URL (e.g. `https://alpha.uipath.com`)

**No `tenantId` in this output.** Read PAT and TENANT_ID from `~/.uipath/.auth`
as described in `../../primitives/auth-context.md` Steps 3–4.

## Phase 3 — Metric Derivation (0 tool calls)
For each metric in the NLP prompt, derive using build-plan.md four-axis decomposition:
- Shape, time frame, aggregation, service (SDK or Insights)
- Route each metric using data-router.md routing table

## Phase 4 — Plan (0 tool calls)
Render the plan using the format in build-plan.md (the grouped bullet format with plain-English descriptions).

**Do NOT show in the plan:**
- `[Insights]` / `[SDK]` labels
- API method names (`getAgents`, `getSummaryV2`, etc.)
- Chart type labels ("KPI card", "area chart")
- Any technical implementation detail

**Do show:**
- Widget name + time range
- One sentence per widget: what it shows + why it matters to the user
- Theme groupings when there are 4+ widgets (Overview / Trends / Detail / etc.)
- A "What you can do" block with 3–4 example edits

Do NOT write any files yet.

## Phase 5 — Approval Gate (0 tool calls)
HALT. Wait for user response.
Follow approval gate rules in build-plan.md exactly.
Do not proceed until explicit approval is received.

## Phase 6 — Scaffold (1 Bash)
Read PAT and tenantId from `~/.uipath/.auth` (env-file format) as described in `../../primitives/auth-context.md` Step 3. Then copy the scaffold template and write `.env.local`:

```bash
# SKILL_ASSETS: use this skill's base directory (shown in your system context
# as "Base directory for this skill"). The scaffold is at:
#   [SKILL_BASE_DIR]/assets/templates/dashboard/scaffold/
# Replace SKILL_BASE_DIR with the actual path from your system context.
SKILL_BASE_DIR="<SKILL_BASE_DIR>"
SKILL_ASSETS="${SKILL_BASE_DIR}/assets"

# Read auth from ~/.uipath/.auth (env-file format)
PAT=$(grep -m1 '^UIPATH_ACCESS_TOKEN=' ~/.uipath/.auth | cut -d'=' -f2-)
TENANT_ID=$(grep -m1 '^UIPATH_TENANT_ID=' ~/.uipath/.auth | cut -d'=' -f2-)
if [ -z "$PAT" ]; then
  PAT=$(node -e "const a=JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync(process.env.HOME+'/.uipath/.auth','utf8')); console.log(a.UIPATH_ACCESS_TOKEN||a.access_token||'')" 2>/dev/null)
  TENANT_ID=$(node -e "const a=JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync(process.env.HOME+'/.uipath/.auth','utf8')); console.log(a.UIPATH_TENANT_ID||a.tenantId||'')" 2>/dev/null)
fi

# Derive base URLs from DATA_BASE_URL
if echo "$DATA_BASE_URL" | grep -q "alpha";    then API_BASE_URL="https://alpha.api.uipath.com"
elif echo "$DATA_BASE_URL" | grep -q "staging"; then API_BASE_URL="https://staging.api.uipath.com"
else API_BASE_URL="https://api.uipath.com"
fi

cp -r "${SKILL_ASSETS}/templates/dashboard/scaffold/." <PROJECT_DIR>/
# Remove any node_modules the template developer may have left — prevents npm ci ENOTEMPTY
node -e "require('fs').rmSync('<PROJECT_DIR>/node_modules', {recursive:true, force:true})" 2>/dev/null || true

cd <PROJECT_DIR>
cat > .env.local << EOF
VITE_UIPATH_CLOUD_URL=${DATA_BASE_URL}
VITE_UIPATH_BASE_URL=${API_BASE_URL}
VITE_UIPATH_ORG_NAME=<ORG_NAME>
VITE_UIPATH_TENANT_NAME=<TENANT_NAME>
VITE_INSIGHTS_TENANT_ID=${TENANT_ID}
VITE_UIPATH_PAT=${PAT}
EOF
npm ci 2>/dev/null
```

No client ID, no scope, no OAuth setup required. The PAT comes from the active `uip login` session. For production deployment the PAT is stripped before build (failBuildIfPatSet Vite plugin enforces this).

> **SKILL_BASE_DIR:** Check your system context for "Base directory for this skill" — it shows the exact path where skill assets are installed. Use that as `SKILL_BASE_DIR`. On a fresh Claude Code session this is always available.

## Phase 7 — Widget Generation (1 parallel Write block, **zero template reads**)

> **Do NOT read widget template files from `assets/templates/dashboard/widgets/`.**
> The Widget Recipes in `insights-catalog.md` (already loaded in Phase 1) contain
> copy-paste-ready widget code with typed `useInsights` calls, response interfaces,
> and extraction patterns. Use those directly — reading templates adds 6–8 sequential
> file reads (~20-30s) for no benefit.

For each widget in the approved plan:
1. Find the matching recipe in `insights-catalog.md` → "Widget Recipes" section
2. If no exact recipe matches, pick the closest one and adapt the endpoint + title
3. Write the complete widget file directly — copy the recipe block, set `<COMPONENT_NAME>` and `<TITLE>`

If a metric has no matching recipe, use the Response Unwrapping table below:

| Pattern | Extraction |
|---|---|
| `data[].{field}` (most timelines) | `(data as any)?.data ?? []` |
| `{ data: { agents[] } }` (getAgents) | `(data as any)?.data?.agents ?? []` |
| `{ totalErrors, data[] }` (topErroredAgents) | `(data as any)?.data ?? []` |
| `{ data: { errorCount, escalationCount } }` (incidentDistribution) | `Object.entries((data as any)?.data ?? {}).map(([name,value]) => ({name,value}))` |
| KPI from `currentPeriodSummary` | `String((data as any)?.data?.currentPeriodSummary?.successRate?.toFixed(1) + '%' ?? '—')` |

Write ALL widget files in a single parallel message (one Write call per widget file).
Also write `<PROJECT_DIR>/src/widgets/index.ts` exporting all components.
Update `<PROJECT_DIR>/src/App.tsx` to import widgets and pass them as children to `<DashboardShell>`.

## Phase 8 — Validate + Summary (2 Bash)
```bash
cd <PROJECT_DIR> && tsc --noEmit
```
If errors → fix them before proceeding. Common fixes:
- Missing import → add import at top of file
- Type mismatch on `data` → add `as <ExpectedType>` cast

```bash
# Verify Vite can start (dry-run check only — don't actually start server)
cd <PROJECT_DIR> && npx vite --version > /dev/null 2>&1 && echo "VITE_OK"
```

## Summary Format (shown after tsc passes)

Write the summary as follows — no technical language, no file paths:

```
✨ Your **[Dashboard Title]** is ready.

**Preview:** Run `npm run dev` in the project folder, then open http://localhost:5173

**What's inside:**
[For each widget, write one bullet using this pattern:]
• **[Widget Title]** — [Plain-English description of what this shows and why it matters to the user. Focus on the business insight, not the data source.]

**Example bullets (use as a guide for tone):**
• **Active Agents** — How many agents are currently running in your fleet at a glance
• **Invocation Volume** — How busy your agents were over the past 24 hours, charted by hour
• **Error Rate Trend** — Whether your error rate is improving or worsening this week
• **Top Agents by Performance** — Which agents are handling the most work and how fast they respond

When you're ready to publish to Automation Cloud, say **"deploy this dashboard"**.
```

## Incremental Mode (existing dashboard)
If a `<PROJECT_DIR>/src/widgets/` directory already exists:
1. Read all existing widget files before writing
2. Write ONLY new widget files (do not regenerate existing ones)
3. Update `index.ts` to add the new export
4. Run `tsc --noEmit` after addition

## Error Handling
- `npm ci` fails with "missing package-lock.json" → fall back to `npm install`
- `npm ci` fails with network error → retry once; if still failing check internet connectivity
- `tsc --noEmit` errors → fix; max 2 fix attempts before asking user
- Dev server fails → still report success with `tsc` passing; note server issue
