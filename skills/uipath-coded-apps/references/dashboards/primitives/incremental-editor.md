# Incremental Editor

Handles ADD / REMOVE / CHANGE / REBUILD requests on existing dashboards.

## Trigger

Detects `.dashboard/state.json` at session start or after `BUILD_RESULT`. State schema: [state-file.md](state-file.md).

## edit-intent.json schema

Write to `<PROJECT_DIR>/edit-intent.json`. **Multiple changes = ONE `ops` batch — never run the script once per change.** The whole batch is validated up front (nothing is written if any op would fail), applied in order, and Dashboard.tsx/index.ts + tsc run once at the end.

`edit-intent.json` carries **metadata only** — no `fnBody` fields. Data-fetch code ships as `metrics/<name>.ts` modules sibling to `edit-intent.json`.

```json
{
  "projectDir": "/abs/path",
  "ops": [
    { "op": "CHANGE", "target": "MemoryCallsTrend", "delta": { "displayAs": "bar-chart" } },
    { "op": "REMOVE", "target": "AgentConsumption" },
    { "op": "ADD", "metric": { "name": "agent-health", "tier": "T1", "title": "Agent Health" } }
  ]
}
```

Op shapes:
- **ADD** — `metric` is a full intent.json metric entry (metadata only, no `fnBody`). Also write `metrics/<name>.ts` module alongside `edit-intent.json` — the build copies it in.
- **REMOVE** — `target` is the widget component name from state.json. Also delete the corresponding `metrics/<name>.ts` module.
- **CHANGE** — `delta` merges over the widget's persisted `intentMetric`. Metadata-only changes (e.g. `displayAs`, `title`) leave the existing module in place. Changing query logic requires shipping a new `metrics/<name>.ts` module alongside the op.
- **REBUILD** — no fields; regenerates every widget from persisted `intentMetric` + the on-disk `metrics/*.ts` modules (e.g. after template updates). No module changes needed unless also updating queries.

A single-op shorthand (`{ "op": "ADD", "projectDir": "...", "metric": ... }`) is also accepted.

## Run command

```bash
node "${SKILL_BASE_DIR}/assets/scripts/build-dashboard.mjs" "${EDIT_INTENT_PATH}"
```

## CHANGE semantics

Each widget's full intent metric (title, display hints) is persisted in `state.json` at build time. CHANGE merges your `delta` over it, so a delta only needs the fields that change. The data-fetch code lives in the on-disk `src/metrics/<name>.ts` module.

1. **Changing the time window requires a new module.** The module imports time constants by name (e.g. `THIRTY_DAYS_AGO`) from `@/lib/time` — a `timeRange` delta alone updates the subtitle but not the query window. Ship an updated `metrics/<name>.ts` using the matching constant (`SEVEN_DAYS_AGO` for 7d, etc.) alongside the delta.
2. Changing `displayAs` between chart ↔ table/kpi is supported — the build regenerates or removes the detail view accordingly.
3. **Legacy dashboards** (built before intent persistence) have no stored `intentMetric` — the build fails with a clear message; include the full metric (title, display hints) in `delta` and ship a fresh module, or re-run a fresh build.

## Stage A type-check

Before applying any op, the build type-checks all affected `metrics/*.ts` modules in isolation (Stage A).
- `METRICS_PASS` — silent; batch proceeds.
- `METRICS_RETRY:{ files: [...], errors: [...] }` — fix the named `src/metrics/<name>.ts` files and re-run. Max 2 attempts; if still failing, drop the metric.

## Events to watch

- `HAND_EDIT_DETECTED:{"widget":"X"}` — file was hand-edited; the whole batch is rejected before any write. Ask the user (see [customization.md](customization.md)).
- `METRICS_PASS` — silent; proceed
- `METRICS_RETRY:{"files":[...],"errors":[...]}` — fix named module files and re-run
- `TSC_PASS` — edit validated clean
- `TSC_FAIL:{"errors":"..."}` — surface to user
- `INCREMENTAL_READY:{"count":N,"ops":[{"op":"ADD","widget":"X"},…]}` — done; the running dev server hot-reloads automatically. If no dev-server background job is running, start one per `plugins/build/impl.md` Phase 4 Step 4 (the script never starts servers).

## Rules

0. **Customized project?** If the user hand-edited files (or asks for look-and-feel changes), read [customization.md](customization.md) BEFORE running any edit-intent — the build regenerates `Dashboard.tsx` + `widgets/index.ts` on every op and would wipe their changes.
1. Only regenerate affected widget files — never the full scaffold.
1b. **Batch every multi-widget request into one `ops` array** ("convert everything to charts" = one run with N CHANGE ops, not N runs). One layout regen, one tsc.
2. Routing name never changes on edit.
3. After REMOVE or CHANGE: always regenerate Dashboard.tsx and widgets/index.ts (the build does this automatically).
4. Chart widgets get their detail view regenerated on ADD/CHANGE/REBUILD automatically — never hand-create views.
5. Do not touch .env.local unless user explicitly requests a config change.
