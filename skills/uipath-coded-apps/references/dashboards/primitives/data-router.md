# Data Router — SDK vs Insights

Rule: SDK for operational state (current counts, list views, snapshots).
      Insights for analytics (historical trends, aggregations, percentiles, derived metrics).

## Routing Table

All Insights API calls are POST JSON with body `{ "tenantId": "<UUID>", "startTime": "...", ... }`.

| Intent signals                                           | Route    | Call                                                       |

## Tie-breaking Rules
- "job count today" → SDK (current state); "job count over 7 days" → Insights `jobs.getCompletedTimeline`
- "queue depth" → SDK; "queue throughput trend" → no Insights endpoint, stay SDK
- P50/P95/P99 latency → Insights `agents.getLatencyTimeline` (fleet) or `traceview.getLatencyTimeline` (trace)
- "agent health" snapshot → Insights `agents.getAgents` (has `healthScore`); "success rate over time" → `agents.getSummaryV2`
- `governance.getPolicySummary` requires `policy` (UUID) in body in addition to `tenantId`
- "invocation volume" / "run count" / "calls over time" → agents.getConsumptionTimeline (returns time-bucketed aguConsumption; interpret as activity proxy until a dedicated invocation-count endpoint is available)
- "important metrics" / "key metrics" / "overview" with no other qualifier → agents.getSummaryV2 for success/duration KPIs + agents.getAgents for fleet health
- getSummaryV2 is AGGREGATE-ONLY (returns a single summary object for the period, not a time-series array). Never use it as the data source for area, line, or bar charts. Use getErrors, getConsumptionTimeline, or getLatencyTimeline for time-series charts.

## SDK Import Pattern
```typescript
import { UiPath } from '@uipath/uipath-typescript/core';
import { Jobs } from '@uipath/uipath-typescript/jobs';
// Never root imports — always subpath exports
```

## Insights Hook Pattern
```typescript
import { useInsights } from '../hooks/useInsights';
// Key is namespace.method
const { data, loading, error } = useInsights(
  'agents.getSummaryV2',
  { startTime: '2025-01-01T00:00:00Z' }
);
```
