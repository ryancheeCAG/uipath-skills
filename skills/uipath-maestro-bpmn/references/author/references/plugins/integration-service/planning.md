# Integration Service Planning

Integration Service activities and triggers are CLI-owned or CLI-enriched. The model may plan the node and surrounding BPMN structure, but it must not invent connector metadata, connection identifiers, dynamic schemas, or binding resources.

## When to use

Use this plugin reference when a BPMN process needs:

- A connector activity.
- A connector trigger.
- A wait-for-event shape backed by Integration Service.
- Unified HTTP or connector-authenticated HTTP behavior.
- Dynamic input/output schemas from connector metadata.

## Planning steps

1. Identify the connector, operation/event, object, and user-visible intent.
2. Determine whether the element is a trigger, wait event, activity, or HTTP-style call.
3. Check whether the process can proceed with a draft placeholder or must stop until enrichment is available.
4. Record required user decisions: connector, connection, folder/resource scope, operation, filters, required parameters, and output variables.
5. Keep the surrounding BPMN structure model-authored: start/event/task placement, sequence flows, gateways, error handling, and diagrams.
6. Hand the Integration Service element to CLI enrichment before validation for upload/debug/publish.

## Model may draft

- A placeholder service task, start event, or intermediate event with a stable element ID.
- Public-safe display naming.
- Surrounding sequence flows, gateways, boundary errors, and variable mappings.
- A comment or open question stating which connector operation must be enriched.

## CLI must provide

- Connector key and operation/event metadata.
- Connection binding and resource metadata.
- Context fields such as object name, activity, operation, filter expression, and trigger properties.
- Dynamic schemas and generated output metadata.
- `bindings_v2.json` entries and resource metadata.
- Validation that the selected connection and operation are available.

## Stop conditions

Stop before real run/upload if:

- No selected connection exists.
- The connector operation is unknown.
- Required parameters are not resolved.
- Generated schemas are missing for an executable element.
- The element contains pasted private connection or tenant identifiers.
