# Supported Elements

Use this supported coverage map before choosing a BPMN wrapper or UiPath extension type. Treat anything outside this map, or listed in [Current generation exclusions](#current-generation-exclusions), as preserve-only unless a newer product contract says otherwise.

## Modeling rule

Pick the BPMN element first, then pick the UiPath execution recipe.

- RPA workflows, agents, API workflows, and most async external executions are `bpmn:serviceTask`.
- Queue item creation is `bpmn:sendTask`; create-and-wait queue work is `bpmn:serviceTask`.
- Business rules are `bpmn:businessRuleTask`.
- HITL is `bpmn:userTask`.
- Agentic process and case-management process calls are `bpmn:callActivity`.
- Integration Service waits are `bpmn:receiveTask` or event wrappers, and their executable metadata is CLI-owned.
- Script work is `bpmn:scriptTask`; it is not a generic service task.

## Standard BPMN coverage

The model may author these standard BPMN structures when the process intent is clear and every visible element has BPMN DI.

| Family | Supported elements |
| --- | --- |
| Events | `bpmn:startEvent`, `bpmn:endEvent`, `bpmn:intermediateCatchEvent`, `bpmn:intermediateThrowEvent`, `bpmn:boundaryEvent` |
| Event definitions | none, message, timer, error, and terminate end events where valid for that event kind |
| Gateways | `bpmn:exclusiveGateway`, `bpmn:inclusiveGateway`, `bpmn:parallelGateway`, `bpmn:eventBasedGateway` |
| Tasks | `bpmn:task`, `bpmn:serviceTask`, `bpmn:sendTask`, `bpmn:receiveTask`, `bpmn:userTask`, `bpmn:businessRuleTask`, `bpmn:scriptTask` |
| Containers | `bpmn:subProcess`, event subprocess when the start event type is supported, `bpmn:callActivity` |
| Flow | `bpmn:sequenceFlow` with source, target, optional condition, optional default references on gateways |
| Definitions and visual context | `bpmn:message`, `bpmn:error`, item definitions, data objects, data stores, text annotations, groups, pools, and lanes when required by the model |

Visual-only elements such as pools, lanes, data objects, data stores, text annotations, and groups can describe the model but do not execute. Do not use them as substitutes for executable variables, mappings, or task payloads.

## Current generation exclusions

Do not generate these BPMN structures in new Maestro BPMN source. If they appear
in imported or brownfield files, preserve them and report that the skill cannot
safely regenerate or normalize them unless a current product contract and local
CLI validation prove support.

Planned, future, preview, and TBD support statuses are treated as unsupported
for generation until they are confirmed by current tooling.

| Family | Excluded from new generation |
| --- | --- |
| Gateways | `bpmn:complexGateway` |
| Tasks and containers | `bpmn:manualTask`, `bpmn:adHocSubProcess`, `bpmn:transaction` |
| Event definitions | `bpmn:conditionalEventDefinition`, `bpmn:signalEventDefinition`, `bpmn:escalationEventDefinition`, `bpmn:compensateEventDefinition`, `bpmn:cancelEventDefinition`, `bpmn:linkEventDefinition`, multiple event definitions, and parallel multiple event definitions |
| Markers | Standard loop markers and compensation markers. Use only documented multi-instance parallel or sequential metadata for new loops. |

Terminate is supported only for end events. Do not generate terminate starts,
boundary events, intermediate catches, or intermediate throws.

## UiPath extension coverage

Use lower-case XML tags in authored examples: `uipath:activity`, `uipath:event`, and `uipath:mapping`.
For copyable canonical shells, including the required nested
`uipath:type value="..."` element, see
[../../shared/wrapper-shells.md](../../shared/wrapper-shells.md). Do not use legacy
`<uipath:activity type="...">` shorthand in new XML.
For resource-backed tasks, `uipath:activity` identifies the wrapper type and
resource context; task payload inputs and outputs belong in sibling
`uipath:mapping version="v1"` elements.

| Extension type | BPMN wrapper | XML tag | Ownership |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `BPMN.Variables` | `bpmn:task` | `uipath:mapping` | Model-owned |
| `BPMN.ScriptTask` | `bpmn:scriptTask` | `uipath:mapping` plus `uipath:scriptVersion` | Model-owned; parser executes as `Scp.Script` |
| `Actions.HITL` | `bpmn:userTask` | `uipath:activity` | Model may draft shell; resource/form binding resolved by CLI or operator |
| `Orchestrator.StartJob` | `bpmn:serviceTask` | `uipath:activity` | Model may draft shell; resource binding and schemas resolved by CLI or operator |
| `Orchestrator.StartAgentJob` | `bpmn:serviceTask` | `uipath:activity` | Model may draft shell; agent binding and schemas resolved by CLI or operator |
| `A2A.AgentExecution` | `bpmn:serviceTask` | `uipath:activity` | Model may draft shell; agent metadata resolved by CLI or operator |

| `Orchestrator.CreateAndWaitForQueueItem` | `bpmn:serviceTask` | `uipath:activity` | Model may draft shell; queue binding and callback behavior resolved by CLI or operator |
| `Orchestrator.BusinessRules` | `bpmn:businessRuleTask` | `uipath:activity` | Model may draft shell; rule binding and schemas resolved by CLI or operator |

| `Orchestrator.StartAgenticProcessAsync` | `bpmn:callActivity` | `uipath:activity` | Model may draft shell; called process binding resolved by CLI or operator |
| `Orchestrator.StartCaseMgmtProcess` | `bpmn:callActivity` | `uipath:activity` | Preserve or draft only with a dedicated case-management contract |
| `Orchestrator.StartCaseMgmtProcessAsync` | `bpmn:callActivity` | `uipath:activity` | Preserve or draft only with a dedicated case-management contract |
| `Maestro.ReceiveMessageEvent` | start, intermediate catch, or boundary message event | `uipath:event` | Model-owned when message name and public-safe payload contract are known |
| `Maestro.SendMessageEvent` | intermediate throw or end message event | `uipath:event` | Model-owned when message name and public-safe payload contract are known |
| `Maestro.CasePlanScheduler` | `bpmn:serviceTask` | `uipath:activity` | Preserve or draft only with a dedicated case-management contract |
| `Maestro.CaseManagerGuardrails` | `bpmn:serviceTask` | `uipath:activity` | Preserve-only until documented |
| `Maestro.CaseRulesEvaluator` | `bpmn:serviceTask` | `uipath:activity` | Preserve-only until documented |
| `Intsvc.ActivityExecution` | `bpmn:sendTask` and supported event wrappers | `uipath:activity` | CLI-owned enrichment |
| `Intsvc.HttpExecution` | `bpmn:sendTask` or intermediate throw | `uipath:activity` | After skeleton confirmation, request-and-continue plain connectionless HTTP may use [http-request.md](task-recipes/http-request.md); connector-authenticated or dynamic HTTP remains CLI-owned enrichment |
| `Intsvc.UnifiedHttpRequest` | `bpmn:sendTask` or intermediate throw | `uipath:activity` | CLI-owned enrichment |
| `Intsvc.AsyncExecution` | `bpmn:serviceTask` | `uipath:activity` | CLI-owned enrichment |
| `Intsvc.SyncAgentExecution` | `bpmn:serviceTask` | `uipath:activity` | CLI-owned enrichment |

| `Intsvc.WaitForEvent` | `bpmn:receiveTask`, intermediate catch, or boundary message event | `uipath:event` | CLI-owned enrichment |

## Script task runtime

Script tasks execute JavaScript through Jint, not Node.js or a browser runtime.

- Use `bpmn:scriptTask scriptFormat="JavaScript"`.
- Put source in `bpmn:script` CDATA and include `uipath:scriptVersion`; prefer `v3`.
- Inputs are exposed as named JavaScript variables after Maestro maps inputs into an `args` JSON body.
- Available helpers are limited to `uipath.aggregate`, `uipath._aggregate`, `uipath._pipe`, and a no-op `console`.
- There is a 64 MB memory limit and a 30 second execution timeout.
- Do not use packages, filesystem, network, browser globals, or long-running async behavior.
- For version `v2` and later the script may return any JSON value under `response`; older versions must return a JSON object.

## Integration Service boundary

For `Intsvc.*` elements, the model may author the surrounding BPMN shell,
variables, mappings, error paths, diagram geometry, and a non-executable draft
`uipath:type value="Intsvc.<Variant>"` shell with placeholder strings. The
documented pass-2 exception is confirmed plain connectionless HTTP, which must
follow [http-request.md](task-recipes/http-request.md). Connector-backed or
dynamically schematized `Intsvc.*` work still requires the CLI to enrich connector key,
operation/event metadata, connection binding, trigger property bindings,
schemas, generated outputs, `bindings_v2.json`, and package metadata before
upload or run.

## Preservation boundary

If an imported file contains extension types not listed here, preserve them and report that the skill cannot safely regenerate them. Do not delete unknown extensions unless the user explicitly asks for normalization.
