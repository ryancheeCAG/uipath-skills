# Solutions (`uip solution`)

Create, pack, publish, deploy, and manage UiPath solution packages.

> For full option details on any command, use `--help` (e.g., `uip solution deploy run --help`).

## What is a Solution?

A UiPath Solution is a container that groups multiple automation projects (processes, libraries, tests) into a single deployable unit. Solutions enable:

- **Bundled deployment** -- Deploy multiple projects together as one package
- **Version management** -- Track and version the entire solution as a single entity
- **Configuration management** -- Apply environment-specific configuration at deploy time
- **Multi-environment promotion** -- Move solutions through dev, staging, and production

### Solution File Structure

```
MySolution/
├── MySolution.uipx                       <- Manifest. Source of truth: project list + IDs + StudioMinVersion.
├── <ProjectName>/
│   ├── project.uiproj OR project.json    <- Required for add/import. Type auto-detected.
│   ├── bindings.json                     <- Agent runtime bindings. NOT scanned by refresh.
│   ├── bindings_v2.json                  <- Solution refresh reads this (if it exists).
│   └── ...
├── <AnotherProjectName>/                 <- A solution can host many projects side-by-side.
│   ├── project.uiproj OR project.json
│   ├── bindings_v2.json
│   └── ...
├── resources/                            <- Auto-generated on add/import. NEVER hand-edit.
│   └── solution_folder/
│       ├── package/<name>.json           <- Auto-created on add. NOT cleaned by `project remove`.
│       └── process/{process,flow}/<name>.json   <- Auto-created on add. Auto-cleaned on remove.
└── userProfile/<user-uuid>/              <- Appears after first `project remove`.
```

> `.uipx` and `resources/solution_folder/` must always agree on the set of projects. Diffing them is the fastest way to detect a corrupted state — see [develop-solution.md - Field-tested gotchas](develop-solution.md#field-tested-gotchas).
>
> The `.uipx` also carries a `StudioMinVersion` field (e.g. `2025.10.0`). If users hit a version-mismatch when opening the solution, that's the constraint to check.

> **Coded apps are not registered in `.uipx`.** UiPath Coded Web Apps and Coded Action Apps have no `project.uiproj` / `project.json` — `uip solution project add` does not apply, and they are not packed by `uip solution pack`. They deploy independently via `uip codedapp publish` / `deploy`. A coded app directory can sit alongside a solution but is not part of its manifest. See [/uipath:uipath-coded-apps](/uipath:uipath-coded-apps).

## Solution Lifecycle

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[init] --> B[project add]
    B --> C[resource refresh]
    C --> D[pack]
    D --> E[publish]
    E --> F["deploy run<br/>(auto-activate by default)"]
    F -->|--skip-activate| G[activate]
    C --> H[upload]
```

Two distinct distribution paths from the same solution source:
- **`pack` → `publish` → `deploy run`** — promotes a versioned package to Orchestrator.
- **`upload`** — pushes the solution to Studio Web for browser-based debugging only. Does not produce a published package and cannot be deployed via `deploy run`.

Always run `resource refresh` before either path so the bundled artefact files and `userProfile/<userId>/debug_overwrites.json` reflect the current cloud state.
