# Skill Structure Rules

These rules enforce consistency across all skills in this repository.

## Folder Layout

Every skill MUST follow this structure:

```
skills/uipath-<name>/
├── SKILL.md              # Required — skill definition
├── references/           # Optional — supporting docs
│   └── *.md              # Kebab-case filenames
└── assets/               # Optional — templates, static files
    └── templates/        # Optional — code/config templates
```

## SKILL.md Frontmatter

Every SKILL.md MUST begin with valid YAML frontmatter containing at minimum:

```yaml
---
name: uipath-<name>
description: "<identity> (<unique signal>). <core actions>. For <confusing-case>→<correct-skill>."
---
```

### Validation Rules

- `name` MUST exactly match the parent folder name
- `description` MUST be under 1024 characters. Claude Code truncates `description` + `when_to_use` at 1,536 chars in the skill listing ([source](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills.md)); 1024 is the repo cap to keep descriptions focused and leave headroom
- `description` MUST front-load the skill identity and unique file/domain signals (e.g., `.cs`, `.xaml`, `.flow`) within the first ~100 characters — the first ~100 chars carry the most matching signal
- `description` MUST start with the brand or domain identity (e.g., `UiPath`, `UiPath RPA`, `UiPath Maestro Flow`). Do NOT prefix with metadata tags like `[PREVIEW]`, `[BETA]`, etc. — those displace high-value matching tokens and semantically de-prioritize the skill
- Lifecycle status (Stable / Preview / In-development) MUST be recorded ONLY in [`assets/skill-status.json`](../../assets/skill-status.json) — the single source of truth. Do NOT put status markers in the frontmatter `description` OR the body (no `> **Preview**` callouts). See [Lifecycle Status](#lifecycle-status) below
- `description` MUST include compact redirects for commonly confused sibling skills using `→` notation (e.g., `For XAML→uipath-rpa`)
- `description` MUST NOT use verbose `TRIGGER when:` / `DO NOT TRIGGER when:` clauses — these waste characters and get truncated. Use `→` redirects for sibling disambiguation instead
- All frontmatter fields (`allowed-tools`, `user-invocable`, etc.) MUST be at the top level — NOT nested under a `metadata:` key (Claude Code only reads top-level fields)
- Frontmatter MUST be valid YAML (no tabs, proper quoting of strings with colons)

## SKILL.md Body Structure

The markdown body SHOULD follow this order:

1. **Title** (`# Skill Title`)
2. **When to Use This Skill** — bullet list of activation scenarios
3. **Critical Rules** — numbered list of mandatory constraints
4. **Quick Start / Workflow** — step-by-step common use case
5. **Reference Navigation** — links to files in `references/`
6. **Anti-patterns** (optional) — "What NOT to Do" section

## Lifecycle Status

Every skill has a maturity status recorded in [`assets/skill-status.json`](../../assets/skill-status.json) — the single source of truth. There is NO status marker in SKILL.md (frontmatter or body). Keeping status in one machine-readable file lets agents and the generated README table report it consistently, and keeps status changes out of frontmatter (so they don't trigger the `activation-gate.yml` recall-eval gate).

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `stable` | Stable, production-ready surface; safe for production. |
| `preview` | Not yet stable; may be broadly available or gated/allowlisted, and surface and behavior may change. |
| `in-development` | Skill itself is incomplete or unstable; coverage is partial. |

When adding or changing a skill, set its entry under `skills` in the manifest to one of these values, then regenerate the README table:

```bash
python3 scripts/check-skill-status.py --write-readme
```

`scripts/check-skill-status.py` (run in CI by `validate-skill-status.yml`) enforces that every skill has a manifest entry with a valid status, that the README table is current, and that no status markers leak into SKILL.md frontmatter or body.

## Naming Conventions

| Item | Pattern | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| Skill folder | `uipath-<kebab-case>` | `uipath-rpa` |
| Reference files | `<topic>-<type>.md` | `commands-reference.md` |
| Guide files | `<topic>-guide.md` | `orchestrator-guide.md` |
| Template files | `<name>-template.<ext>` | `codedworkflow-template.md` |
| Subdirectories | `kebab-case/` | `integration-service/` |

## Content Rules

- Skills MUST be self-contained — no references to other skills
- CLI commands MUST include `--output json` when output is parsed programmatically
- All file links MUST use relative paths from the SKILL.md location
- All file links MUST point to files that actually exist in the repo
- No secrets, tokens, credentials, or personal filesystem paths
